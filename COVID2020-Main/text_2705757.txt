Remember that whole segment John Oliver did last year, where he filmed with two giant Japanese otter mascots, Chiijohn and Shinjo-kun? The end result was an undeniable cinematic masterpiece, but it turns out the filming process wasn't exactly smooth sailing. "So they don't speak English, but they also won't speak at all," Oliver explains to Seth Meyers in the clip above. "They had a translator so I could speak to them, but then they would not respond out of character at all. They basically went full Daniel Day Lewis." Oliver says he was with the mascots for two whole days, and they didn't say a single word. "During breaks they were still in character, kind of grabbing each others' tail while everyone else was eating." Oliver explains that it was charming at first, but less so when he looked through the eye grills of the mascots and saw the silhouettes of the silent strangers inside. Still, the end result was glorious.
