BEIJING/SHANGHAI, March 4 (Reuters) - China will offer cash support to both domestic and foreign carriers to encourage them to restore services and not to suspend flights amid the coronavirus outbreak, the country’s aviation regulator said on Wednesday. For every available seat kilometre, Beijing would award 0.0176 yuan for routes that have been shared by multiple carriers and 0.0528 yuan for routes that are only operated by one carrier, the Civil Aviation Administration of China said. The policy will be effective for flights between Jan. 23 and June 30. Reporting by Stella Qiu in Beijing and Brenda Goh in Shanghai;
