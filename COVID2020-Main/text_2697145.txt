SEOUL, March 1 (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics shut one of its mobile device factories in South Korea after a worker tested positive for the coronavirus, the Yonhap news agency reported, citing a company official. The factory in Gumi, close to Daegu where most of the South Korean virus cases have been confirmed, was temporarily closed last month after an earlier case was discovered. The floor where the infected employee worked will reopen on Tuesday afternoon, Yonhap said. Samsung did not have immediate comment.
