Natus Vincere fought their way out of the lower bracket to defeat G2 Esports on Sunday and win the $500,000 Intel Extreme Masters Katowice 2020 World Championship. The Ukraine-based Natus Vincere lost in the second round of group play to tumble into the lower bracket but were dominant in the playoff round. They swept G2 3-0 in the best-of-five Grand Final, winning 16-4 on Nuke, 16-13 on Dust II and 16-2 on Mirage. In the quarterfinals, NaVi topped Team Liquid and then beat Astralis in the semfinals, both 2-0 victories. With the win, Natus Vincere takes home the $250,000 top prize.
