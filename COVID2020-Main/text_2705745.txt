Merriam Webster defines "face" as "the front part of the head that in humans extends from the forehead to the chin and includes the mouth, nose, cheeks, and eyes." For Donald Trump, this means everything on the orange sphere above his neck but below his white-blonde swoop of hair. It feels silly to be describing what a face is in 2020, but it seems the president is confused. At a meeting on Wednesday, when discussing the highly contagious new coronavirus (which results in the disease that's been officially named COVID-19), with airline executives, Trump said, "I haven’t touched my face in weeks. Been weeks. I miss it." "I haven''t touched my face in weeks. Been weeks. I miss it."— Pres.

If a general sense of doubt that Trump hadn't so much as scratched his nose or rested his head in his hands in literal wasn't enough to discredit his claim, there are photos that show the president clearly made contact between his hands and his face in recent days. In other words, Trump lied. In the photo above, Trump is seen touching his face on March 2 — while leading a meeting with the White House Coronavirus Task Force. In the photo below, taken on Feb. 26, 2020, Trump's hand is again seen touching his face as he speaks about the coronavirus at a news conference. 




 There is of course a chance that Trump's comment was a joke, but since the coronavirus has reportedly killed more than 3,100 people, it would be deeply insensitive to make light of the warning.  Joke or no joke, we are simply here to report that Donald Trump has in fact not gone weeks without touching his own face.
