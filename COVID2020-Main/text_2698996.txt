Duane Tanouye, a retired telecommunications worker who took photographs of the Honolulu Costco that were shared by Reuters, said 200 people were in line outside the store.











 






He told Reuters that the store was limiting how much shoppers could buy of certain products such as toilet paper.










Despite the restrictions, his photos show customers loading up their carts with large quantities of these items. 





There have been mixed messages about how to prepare for the spread of the virus. While Hawaii advised people to stock up, Robert Redfield, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told Congress on Thursday that it wasn't necessary to do so.
