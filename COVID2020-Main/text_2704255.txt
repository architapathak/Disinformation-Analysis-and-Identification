South Korea reported hundreds of new coronavirus cases Wednesday, as officials search for more hospital beds.  Another 435 new cases were confirmed, bringing the nation's total to 5,621, with at least 32 deaths, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said, according to multiple reports.  Most of the cases were reported in and around South Korea's fourth-largest city Daegu, where members of a secretive church have been infected. Authorities predict the number of cases will rise in the coming days as 200,000 members of the church and thousands of others are tested, according to Reuters.  About 2,300 patients are reportedly waiting in temporary medical facilities to be admitted to the hospitals, where beds are currently full.  South Korean Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun called for more medical resources and $9.8 billion in stimulus to fight the coronavirus outbreak, saying, “We need special measures in times of emergency.” “In order to overcome COVID-19 as quickly as possible and minimize the impact on the economy, it is necessary to proactively inject all available resources,” he said, according to Reuters. At least 92 countries have entry restrictions on travelers coming from South Korea, according to the Yonhap news agency.
