(Reuters) - U.S. drugmaker Eli Lilly and Co said on Tuesday it does not expect the coronavirus outbreak to result in shortages for any of its treatments, including all forms of insulin. The company said it does not source active drug ingredients from China for any of its approved medicines and that its insulin manufacturing facilities in the United States and Europe have not been impacted by the outbreak. U.S. officials last week raised concerns over the U.S. drug supply chain in the wake of the outbreak in China, where a significant portion of the ingredients used to make prescription drugs is made. The U.S. drugs regulator had identified 20 drugs with shortage risks and on Thursday announced the first coronavirus-related drug shortage in the country, but declined to name the drug. Lilly said it was in touch with suppliers to ensure supplies of raw materials and that its global manufacturing network was fully operational. “As the global situation evolves, we will continue to take the steps necessary to safeguard the reliable supply of our medicines,” the company said in a statement. Generic drugmaker Mylan NV on Thursday warned that the continued spread of the virus could result in drug shortages. Reporting by Saumya Sibi Joseph in Bengaluru; Editing by Arun Koyyur
