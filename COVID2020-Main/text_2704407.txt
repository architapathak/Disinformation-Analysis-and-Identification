Scientists studying the novel coronavirus in China discovered two different varieties of the infection could be spreading around the world. Researchers at Peking University School of Life Sciences and the Institut Pasteur of Shanghai published a study on Tuesday, identifying a more aggressive type of the virus found in 70 percent of analyzed strains, with 30 percent belonging to a less aggressive variety, according to CNBC. The study indicated that the more aggressive coronavirus primarily exists at the origin point of the virus in Wuhan, China. Researchers say the frequency of the more vigorous variety has diminished since early January. The scientists in this study said the newly discovered variety of coronaviruses is most likely a mutation and maneuver of natural selection as the virus spreads and adapts. However, officials caution that the data in this study is still "very limited," according to the report. "These findings strongly support an urgent need for further immediate, comprehensive studies that combine genomic data, epidemiological data, and chart records of the clinical symptoms of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)," the study said. As of Wednesday, more than 94,000 people worldwide have contracted the deadly coronavirus, with more than 3,200 fatalities, according to Johns Hopkins data. View the discussion thread.
