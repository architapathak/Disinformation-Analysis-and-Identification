TOKYO, March 3 (Reuters) - Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso said on Tuesday the desirable policy response to the economic impact from the coronavirus outbreak will vary from country to country. Speaking to reporters after a conference call by the Group of Seven finance leaders, Aso said it was “significant” that the group shared the need to act against risks from the virus in such a short period of time.
