The Fisker Ocean is finally on the move.  The new electric compact SUV from SoCal-based carmaker Fisker with a solar roof, a heads-up display for karaoke, recycled materials, and windows-down California mode made a splash at CES in Las Vegas earlier this year.  Next, the under-$40,000 EV was supposed to make its European debut. But with the Geneva International Motor Show canceled in Switzerland due to the coronavirus outbreak, the car company (headed by longtime car designer Henrik Fisker) will have to figure out alternate plans.  While ee won't get a big car display this week, the company released the first footage of the car actually driving on a road. It's enough to get a taste of what's to come. It's a quick clip, but that's definitely the Ocean passing a red vehicle that could be a Tesla, right? Don't look too closely and let's embrace the symbolism. Tesla, with its upcoming Model Y small SUV slated for a similarly moderate price, is the main competition for Fisker.  The Fisker Ocean is scheduled to arrive in 2022 and will be the first production car from Fisker since its failed Fisker Karma.
