BEIJING (Reuters) - Four Chinese provinces Yunnan, Guangdong, Shanxi and Guizhou on Monday lowered their coronavirus emergency response measures, local health commissions said. Yunnan and Guizhou cut their emergency response measures from level I to level III, while Guangdong and Shanxi lowered their measures to level II. China has a four-tier response system for public health emergencies that determines what measures it will implement, with level I the most serious. Gansu province was the first to lower its measures on Friday, followed by Liaoning on Saturday.
