Attendees of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) conference may have come into contact with the coronavirus, organizers said Wednesday.  Some policy conference attendees from New York were potentially in contact prior to the conference with an individual who contracted the coronavirus, AIPAC President Betsy Berns Korn and AIPAC Chairman Dr. Mort Fridman said in a note to attendees.   Important Health Note emailed to Policy Conference attendees, participants, speakers, and administration and Hill offices. pic.twitter.com/QzEKXajJBX  The individual who contracted the coronavirus did not attend the conference, and the attendees in contact with the person have been added to the self-quarantine list, AIPAC officials said.  The organizers said that to their knowledge no one who attended the conference has tested positive for the virus at this time.  The D.C. Health Department considers this a low-risk exposure, AIPAC officials said.  "Although we have been told by the DC Health Department there is no reason to 'sound the alarm,' we want to be sure all Policy Conference attendees have the information we have at this time," the note said. Eleven people have tested positive for the coronavirus in New York, including one in New York City, according to state health officials.  View the discussion thread.
