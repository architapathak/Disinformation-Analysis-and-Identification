(Corrects to remove extraneous word in last paragraph) March 5 (Reuters) - U.S. hypermarket chain Costco Wholesale Corp beat market estimates for second-quarter revenue on Thursday, helped by a rise in membership enrollments and online sales. Total revenue rose to $39.07 billion from $35.4 billion, above estimates of $38.24 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Net income attributable to the company rose to $931 million, or $2.10 per share, in the second quarter ended Feb. 16, from $889 million, or $2.01 per share, a year earlier. Costco said February comparable sales rose 11.7%, excluding the impact of fuel and currency fluctuations. The company added that concerns related to the coronavirus outbreak had boosted comparable sales by about 3%. (Reporting by Praveen Paramasivam in Bengaluru; Editing by Krishna Chandra Eluri)
