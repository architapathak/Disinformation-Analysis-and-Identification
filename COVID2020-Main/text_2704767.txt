Saudi Arabia announced Sunday that it has prepared dozens of hospitals for coronavirus cases, as the outbreak is spreading around the world, Reuters reported. The country said it has readied 25 hospitals in the midst of the epidemic around the world, although Saudi Arabia itself has not confirmed any cases. Health ministry spokesman Mohammed Abdelali said 2,200 hospital beds were ready for quarantine needs, during a press conference. The country had announced Thursday that it would close its borders to foreign “umrah” pilgrims, who travel to Islam’s two holiest sites located in the country, Reuters reported. Pilgrimages to these sites are completed all year long. Saudi Arabia has banned tourists from at least 25 countries that have recorded cases of the coronavirus. Officials did say the virus has not affected the country’s trade activity, according to Reuters.  Other countries along the Persian Gulf have reported cases, including Bahrain, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Iraq and Iran. Many of these cases involve those who traveled to Iran or had contact with someone who had been in the country.  Iran currently has reported 54 deaths, the highest death toll outside of China, where the virus is suspected to have originate. The majority of the world’s almost 3,000 deaths occurred in China.  View the discussion thread.
