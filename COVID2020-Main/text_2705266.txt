As New Yorkers prepare for more cases of COVID-19 through community spread and possible self-quarantine, information might come from an unlikely source: a five-foot tall robot. Robotics company Promobot builds "service robots for business," according to its website. Early last month, Reuters reported a Promobot rolling through Time Square in New York. That same week, it was reportedly in Bryant Park in New York, giving out advice about avoiding the coronavirus and handing out facemasks — even though face masks are not an effective way to prevent COVID-19.Take a look here. 













Promobot has a few different models, and it sent the V.4 around New York. The V.4 "communicates with people, moves autonomously and connects with third-party services and external systems: from databases to applications. The robot is autonomous – it does not need human control for its work."

In Times Square, the Promobot had a device with a touch screen on its chest.











 






People walking by could fill out questionnaires on the touch screen. "We did a special software to detect coronavirus symptoms," chief business development officer Oleg Kivorkutsev told Reuters.

"We were trying to tell people about the virus. We're bringing attention to the problem" Kivorkutsev told the New York Post.

Promobot doesn't actually diagnose COVID-19. Instead, it asks about symptoms associated with the virus, like a fever. If the user selected "no," they get a message reassuring them that they likely don't have COVID-19.










The CDC says symptoms could appear up to two weeks after exposure, so just because a person doesn't have a fever doesn't necessarily mean that they are virus-free. 





Touchscreens can carry bacteria, and they shouldn't be cleaned with a rubbing alcohol and disinfectants. The screen does not seem to be cleaned between users, creating another possible source of spreading the coronavirus.

It reportedly performed 300 tests, and no one reported symptoms consistent with COVID-19.

Promobot, which has a friendly, smiling face, was also reportedly distributing face masks, even though they are not an effective way to prevent COVID-19.

Days later, Promobot was spotted in Bryant Park asking people to fill out the same survey.

The robot was kicked out of the park for lacking a permit, according to both Kivorkutsev and a spokesperson from Bryant Park.

Promobot showed off the V.4 at the International Homeland Security Exhibition in Moscow in October.















Promobot can perform all sorts of jobs, according to the company, including consultant, building manager, and tour guide.

Along with the touch screen, it comes with a thermal printer, 3D sensor, video analysis system, USB port, and more.















Promobot can even sing along to the Beatles, and dance to Pitbull, among other features, Kivorkutsev told the New York Post.
