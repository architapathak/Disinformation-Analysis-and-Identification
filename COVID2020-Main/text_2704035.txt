Italian sporting events will be played in empty stadiums for at least the next month as the Italian government tries to stem the coronavirus outbreak that has hit the country. The ban extends until at least April 3, and schools in the country have been shut down until March 15, The Associated Press reported. Italy is the European country that has been hit hardest by the virus, with health officials reporting more than 3,000 confirmed cases and more than 100 coronavirus-related deaths. Italy's top soccer league, Serie A, had postponed six matches until next week because of the virus but will now play those games this weekend, according to the news wire. That includes the Juventus-Inter match, also known as the "Derby d'Italia," one of the biggest games of the season. Italy's Six Nations rugby match against Ireland on March 7 has been postponed, and the country's tilt with England on March 14 could be jeopardy as well. Northern Italy has been hit hardest by the coronavirus, with the Lombardy region being the epicenter of the country's outbreak. View the discussion thread.
