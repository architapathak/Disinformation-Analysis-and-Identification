The release of the latest installment in the James Bond movie franchise is reportedly being pushed back amid fears of the coronavirus. "No Time to Die," starring Daniel Craig as the famed fictional MI6 agent 007, was poised to hit theaters in the United States on April 10. It now will be released on Nov. 25, MGM and Universal studios, along with the film's producers, said in a Wednesday statement, according to Deadline. The statement said the decision to postpone the highly anticipated flick was made after "careful consideration and thorough evaluation of the global theatrical marketplace." No mention was made in the studio's statement about the coronavirus — which has been contracted by more than 94,000 people worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins data. An MGM spokeswoman didn't immediately return ITK's request for comment. Last month, promotional tours for the movie were canceled in China, Japan and South Korea. View the discussion thread.
