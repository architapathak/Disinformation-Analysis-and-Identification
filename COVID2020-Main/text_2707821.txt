The blue-chip index gained 1.5% ahead of a G7 central bank conference call of governors and finance ministers that is expected to deal with the outbreak, although a source at the group said it would not detail any immediate fiscal or monetary steps to boost growth. The domestically focused mid-cap index also rose 1.5%, led by British marketing firm 4imprint Group, which jumped 13% after saying it had so far seen minimal impact from the health crisis. Oil majors BP Plc and Royal Dutch Shell Plc gained 1.7% and 1.4%, tracking oil prices. Reporting by Devik Jain; Editing by Bernard Orr
