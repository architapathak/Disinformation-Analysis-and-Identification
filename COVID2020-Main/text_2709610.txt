FRANKFURT, March 4 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank’s rate-setting Governing Council held a telephone conference meeting late on Tuesday to assess the impact of the coronavirus outbreak, two sources told Reuters. The meeting, held after the Federal Reserve’s rate cut, discussed operational issues and a monetary policy response was not on the agenda, the sources said. An ECB spokesman declined to comment. The bank’s next scheduled meeting is on March 12. Reporting by Balazs Koranyi, editing by Louise Heavens
