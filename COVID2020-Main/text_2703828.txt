Financial ministers and central bankers of the Group of Seven major economies will hold a teleconference Tuesday morning to coordinate a response to the coronavirus outbreak, a U.S. Treasury Department spokesperson confirmed. The meeting comes as new cases continue to be identified outside of China and as the death toll has risen above 3,000. The U.S., U.K., Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan are members of the G-7. International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva and World Bank President David Malpass also jointly put out a statement this morning, saying they “stand ready” to help member countries weather the “human tragedy and economic challenges” posed by the virus. “We will use our available instruments to the fullest extent possible, including emergency financing, policy advice, and technical assistance,” they said. “In particular, we have rapid financing facilities that, collectively, can help countries respond to a wide range of needs.” Stocks, which last week suffered their worst rout since the 2008 financial crisis, showed signs this morning of stopping their plunge, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average up more than 700 points, or 2.84 percent, at around noon.
