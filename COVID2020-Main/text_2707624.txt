CAPE TOWN (Reuters) - South Africa’s health minister said on Thursday that authorities would start a wider search for contacts of the country’s first confirmed coronavirus case, revealing that he was a citizen who had passed through the main airport showing no symptoms. The infected person had just come back from Italy. Health Minister Zweli Mkhize added that it was possible South Africa would run short of protective clothing.
