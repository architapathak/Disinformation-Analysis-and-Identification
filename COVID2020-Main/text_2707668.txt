March 3 (Reuters) - Hungarian low-cost airline Wizz Air on Tuesday reported a higher number of passengers for February despite the coronavirus outbreak, which prompted some capacity reduction and slightly lower load factors. The number of passengers grew by 26% to 3 million even as the virus, which has led the airline to cancel several flights, spreads to more than 60 countries, disrupting global travel.
