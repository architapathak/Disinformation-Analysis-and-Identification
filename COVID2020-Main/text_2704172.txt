Congressional offices have already been told to brush up their plan in the case of a pandemic.  Any steps taken in the Capitol would likely be closely scrutinized, adding pressure for lawmakers as they weigh potential actions.  Washington confirmed four more deaths related to the coronavirus on Monday, bringing the total to six. There have been reports of coronavirus cases in 10 states, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Negotiators are still working on an emergency funding bill to combat the coronavirus. Lawmakers want to pass the funding before they leave for a weeklong March recess.  The Trump administration requested $2.5 billion, half of which would be new funding.  But a source familiar with the talks said on Monday that negotiators are looking at between $7 billion to $8 billion — roughly triple what was initially requested by the White House.  View the discussion thread.
