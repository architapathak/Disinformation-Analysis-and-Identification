The market value of investment-grade rated corporate bonds in the euro area trading on the Tradeweb platform with yields below 0% rose to around 1.18 trillion euros as of the end of February, roughly 33% of the total 3.58 trillion euro market. That was up from around 872 billion euros in January, or 25% of the market, and marked the highest levels since September, Tradeweb data showed. The pile of negative-yielding euro zone government bonds on the Tradeweb platform was broadly unchanged at the end of February at around 5.26 trillion euros or 65% of the total market.
