When you've made your name impersonating a particular politician, it must be kind of surreal to meet them in person. That's exactly what happened to Seth Meyers, though, when he ran into his old Saturday Night Live character John Kerry over the summer. "Here's the thing, I was with my kids earlier in the day, and I was wearing a straw hat, and my youngest son was wearing a straw hat â€” but he didn't want to wear his straw hat," Meyers tells Jimmy Fallon in the clip above. "And I had forgotten right before I went over to say hi to John Kerry, because I was carrying my little one, that I had put his straw hat on top of my straw hat." Luckily, Meyers' wife was on hand to take a photo of the the glorious moment. "He must have been like, 'This is the dickhead who played me?" Meyers jokes. "Could have been in the White House if it wasn't for two-hat Meyers.'"
