Italy, the epicenter of Europe's coronavirus crisis, is preparing to take the unprecedented step of locking down an entire region that is home to more than 10 million people in a bid to control the spread of the epidemic.A draft decree seen by The Wall Street Journal says that the Italian government is imposing sweeping restrictions in the northern region of Lombardy, where Milan is the capital, and 11 neighboring provinces, including Emilia-Romagna, Piedmont, and Veneto.People in these areas should "absolutely avoid any movement into and out of the areas," the decree says, according to The Journal. Bloomberg reported that movement within the affected area will only be permitted when it comes to "non-deferrable" business or health issues.The move comes amid the announcement of 5,883 cases and 233 deaths in Italy.

Once the policy is greenlit, the decision will take effect on Sunday and last through April 3.

Nearly a dozen towns in the country's north have also been sealed off, but the area is home to only about 50,000 people, making Saturday's decision a dramatic escalation, the Journal noted.
