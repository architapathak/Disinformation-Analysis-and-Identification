Intel Labs Day became another casualty of the coronavirus crisis after the tech giant decided to postpone a big R&D meeting with its top researchers and the media.How Intel came to that decision underscores the uncertainty surrounding the crisis, which has led some tech companies and organizations to embrace more cautious policies.Intel initially had tried to push through with the event which had been expected to attract roughly 100 people, much smaller than other major tech gatherings that have been called off.Â To prepare for the event, Intel had quizzed would-be attendees about their possible exposure to the virus.They were asked to "confirm" that they have not visited Hong Kong, Macau, Mainland China, South Korea, Japan, Singapore, or Italy, and that they were not going to those countries before the meeting.


They were also asked: "Have you been within 2 meters (approx. six feet) for 30 minutes or more of anyone confirmed to be sick with the Coronavirus in the last 14 days."But Intel subsequently announced that Intel Labs Day had been postponed "after careful consideration," an email from Intel's media relations team said.Other major tech events have been postponed or cancelled, incuding Facebook's F8 conference and the Game Developers Conference.Got a tip about Intel or another tech company?
