The US Navy's 6th Fleet, which primarily operates around Europe and Africa, will impose a 14-day quarantine on ships between port calls in Europe in light of growing concerns over the coronavirus.Any ship visiting a European port will be required to spend at least 14 days at sea afterward, as first reported by CNN."In conjunction with other fleets, we have instituted a 14-day underway period between port visits to allow for crew monitoring," 6th Fleet spokesman Cmdr. Kyle Raines told CNN.Sailors and US Marines from 6th Fleet are responsible for covering half of the Atlantic Ocean and seas around Europe and Africa â€” a total of 20 million square miles of water as well as 14 million square miles of land spanning 105 countries.The new coronavirus has been found in several European countries, including France, Germany, Italy, and the UK.
