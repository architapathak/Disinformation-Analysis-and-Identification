That itching urge to touch your face every few seconds? President Donald Trump is struggling with it too.  In a meeting with airline CEOs amid coronavirus sprawling across the globe, White House coronavirus response coordinator Deboroah Birx talked about the importance of washing one’s hands and face as a preventative measure.  Trump quipped that he’d cut off his frequent face touching, but it hasn’t been easy.  “I haven’t touched my face in weeks!” Trump joked. “I miss it.”  Close followers of the president were quick to note online that the president has been seen and photographed touching his face in recent weeks. The CDC recommends everyday preventative actions for combating the spread of coronavirus like avoiding sick people, not touching your face, staying home when sick, covering coughs and sneezes and disinfecting objects and surfaces.  Face touching in particular has gotten attention in recent days as headlines like “How to stop touching your face” or “Stop touching your face” continue to surface.
