All NASA employees and a number of Air Force personnel have been asked to work from home on Friday amid federal preparations for a potential coronavirus outbreak, according to a NASA spokesperson and an Air Force memo obtained by POLITICO. The day will allow employees to test remote work technologies in case federal employees are forced to work from home for an extended period of time due to the virus. “As the coronavirus (COVID-19) situation continues to evolve, NASA is taking various actions to maintain preparedness,” said Bettina Inclán, a NASA spokesperson. “To that end, Friday, March 6, will be an agency-wide telework day. NASA centers and headquarters regularly perform telework drills to test our capabilities, resources, and preparedness for large-scale teleworking.” Inclán said the opportunity to work from home is voluntary for the agency's 17,000 employees across the country. A former NASA employee called the telework day a chance to “stress test the system” and make sure the technology to remotely connect to the agency’s networks can handle the load in case an outbreak forces large numbers of people to work from home. The Air Force memo says the headquarters of the service "will perform a short-notice telework capacity test" on Friday. The test of capabilities will involve employees who already have an agreement for regular or situational telework, and will not be expanded to all Air Force employees. The memo does not specifically mention coronavirus, instead saying that Air Force leadership is "reviewing emergency preparedness procedures, including the expanded use of telework." Employees are required to submit reports of any technological or connectivity problems on Friday. "The results of this test will be used to ensure we can support a wide range of functions and a higher level of telework capacity should the need arise," the memo says.
