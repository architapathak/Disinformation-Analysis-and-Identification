BMW's electric dreams are closer than ever, with the i4 electric concept unveiled Tuesday.  The car is the next generation of the all-electric i3 that's already out on the road. It's been hyped up for years, especially with BMW's iNext concept car debuting in 2018 to show off features and design elements that will go into the German carmaker's next EV. The newest electric machine was supposed to make a splash at the Geneva International Motor Show, but the Swiss show was canceled because of coronavirus fears. Instead, on Tuesday, a digital debut showed off the sporty but luxurious four-door car's 372-mile range, capability of going 0 to 60 mph in 4 seconds, and top 124-mph speed.   The real i4 — not the concept version shown Tuesday, but something similar — is supposed to start production in 2021. The i4 is expected to have a similar shape, with the slicked-back roofline and strong front grille. It's an all-electric machine with an electric motor and battery pack, so the dramatic front design is mostly for show and a throwback to the gas-powered BMWs that came before. (Electric vehicles don't need as much air ventilation for the engine since, well, it's electric.) The "frozen light copper" color is the same shade as the iNext concept.  Inside, expect a lot of the minimalism with digital displays seen in the iNext concept. It'll sound familiar, too, with EV noises from composer Hans Zimmer.  




 It's got enough tech, but not too much.
 We'll have to wait to see what the final i4 looks like, but, so far, we have a lot of hints.
