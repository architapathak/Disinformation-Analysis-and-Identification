SYDNEY, March 2 (Reuters) - Australia’s financial regulators will discuss the impact of a new coronavirus outbreak on Australia’s A$2 trillion ($1.3 trillion) economy in an emergency meeting on Monday, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters. The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) will meet on Tuesday for its monthly rate review. A Reuters poll last week found few analysts expected a cut from a record low 0.75%, but the sheer scale of market losses around the globe prompted financial futures to now imply a 96% chance of a move compared with just 18% last week.
