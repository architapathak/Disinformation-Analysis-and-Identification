March 3 (Reuters) - British insurer Direct Line said on Tuesday the coronavirus outbreak could hurt results for its travel business this year, as it reported a fall in 2019 profit in the face of steep claims and strong competition on pricing from smaller rivals. The FTSE 250 company, Britainâ€™s biggest motor insurer, said pretax profit fell to 509.7 million pounds ($651.70 million) for the year ended Dec. 31 from 580.5 million pounds a year earlier. In a separate statement, the company also said its Chairman Mike Biggs would step down in 2020 after the appointment of a successor.
