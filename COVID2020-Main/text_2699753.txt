Did Saturday Night Live's cold open really just suggest that no one currently in the U.S. government or the people vying to lead it are ill-equipped to handle the growing threat of the new coronavirus? It sure did, and there's no reason to think SNL is wrong! A cold open sketch that starts with a sleepy White House press conference delivered by Vice President Mike Pence is soon interrupted by every player (for now) in the race to be the Democratic Party's nominee for the 2020 election. Larry David, Rachel Dratch, and Fred Armisen all return to do their impressions of Bernie Sanders, Amy Klobuchar, and Mike Bloomberg, respectively. But it's guest host John Mulaney who steals the sketch. He steps into former Vice President Joe Biden's shoes, wearing a flashy South Carolina sash (as the real Biden logged a win in Saturday's primary in that state) and rambling on about new teeth. Perfect. The real winner of the cold open, however, is all of us. Throughout the sketch, SNL's writers tucked in bits of advice that, taken together, reads like a best practices guide for staying healthy and keeping illness – coronavirus or not! – at bay. It all starts with washing your damn hands.
