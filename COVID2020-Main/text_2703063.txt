Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont went on the attack against the media and former Vice President Joe Biden on Wednesday.Sanders criticized some in the mainstream media for comparing his campaign to the coronavirus and the Nazi occupation of France during World War II.He also drew a stark contrast between his platform and Biden's, taking aim at Biden for everything from his billionaire support to his "disastrous" record on issues like trade and healthcare.Notably, Sanders stood by his belief that the candidate who goes to the Democratic National Convention with a delegate lead, even if it's a plurality, should be the party's nominee.Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.


Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont went on the attack Wednesday following a string of disappointing losses in the Super Tuesday primaries this week.He kicked things off by skewering the mainstream media for adopting what he described as an adversarial stance against his campaign.Sanders noted that some in the media have used the word "venom" when referring to his campaign, and compared it to the novel coronavirus as well as the Nazi occupation of France during World War II."As we come into the last several months of this campaign, what I hope very much is that what we can focus on is an issue-oriented campaign which deals with the concerns of the American people," he said.The senator from Vermont then took aim at former Vice President Joe Biden, highlighting the fact that Biden is "very heavily supported by the corporate establishment" and that he's gotten campaign donations from at least 60 billionaires.


Sanders continued and said he plans to campaign in the midwest before pivoting to Biden's record on trade agreements that have impacted the region.Biden will have to explain "why he supported disastrous trade agreements" like NAFTA, which cost "millions of good paying jobs" and "resulted in a race to the bottom," Sanders said. "Joe is going to have to explain to the American people why he voted for a Wall Street bailout" and "why he was a leader in getting us involved in the war in Iraq."Sanders also excoriated the former vice president for voting for a "disastrous bankruptcy bill that benfited credit card companies" and why he advocated for cuts to Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security when he was a US senator."Joe and I have a very different opinion with regard to healthcare," Sanders said, drawing the focus to his signature campaign issue. "Joe essentially wants to maintain what I consider to be a dysfunctional and cruel healthcare system."But the Sanders emphasized that he's not interested in having a "food fight" with Biden that would be "insulting" to the American people, and instead hopes for a serious debate over issues.


Sanders surged to the front of the crowded Democratic pack after a series of victories in early-voting states like New Hampshire and Nevada, and tied for first place in Iowa.But he suffered a disappointing loss in South Carolina to Biden, who went on to demolish Sanders on Super Tuesday by racking up wins across southern states.The former vice president started the night strong when he overwhelmingly won the Virginia primary, kicking off a winning streak across the country, including states where Sanders led in the polls.Biden won the Alabama, Arkansas, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Minnesota, Tennessee, Massachusetts, and Texas primaries.Sanders, meanwhile, has only won smaller states like Colorado, Utah, and his home of state of Vermont.


California is the Super Tuesday state that holds the largest delegate prize, but the state still hasn't been called.
