As we've learned from the recent Democratic debates, Elizabeth Warren is something of an expert when it comes to verbally destroying her rivals — and during her Monday night appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live!, she once again showcased her skills. This time, the man in the spotlight was one Donald Trump — and, specifically, his worryingly casual reaction to the coronavirus (known officially as COVID-19). "This is really about leadership," says Warren. "And it's why, when serious problems come, you can't just have a guy who believes in magic as the President of the United States." "I don't even think he believes in that," quips Kimmel in response. "Oh come on," responds Warren. "The things he says about himself, he must believe in magic." Ouch.
