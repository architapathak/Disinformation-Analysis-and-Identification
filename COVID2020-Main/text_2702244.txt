SYDNEY, March 2 (Reuters) - U.S. soybean futures rose slightly on Monday amid rising hopes for economic stimulus, though gains were capped by the rapid spread of the coronavirus epidemic across the world. FUNDAMENTALS * The most active soybean futures on the Chicago Board Of Trade were up 0.4% at $8.96-1/4 a bushel by 0136 GMT, near the session high of $8.97-3/4 a bushel - the highest since Feb. 26. Soybeans closed down 0.3% on Friday. * The most active corn futures were up 0.3% at $3.67-3/4 a bushel. Corn closed marginally higher on Friday after hitting its lowest since Nov. 20 at $3.65-3/4. * The most active wheat futures were down 0.1% to $5.23-3/4 a bushel after closing down 0.5% on Friday, when prices hit a Nov. 22 low of $5.13 a bushel. * Leaders in Europe, the Middle East and the Americas rolled out bans on big gatherings and stricter travel restrictions over the weekend as cases of the new coronavirus spread. * Central banks worldwide are expected to cut interest rates in a bid to contain the economic impact of coronavirus. * Argentina's Ministry of Agriculture last week suspended the registration of agricultural exports until further notice, it said, a move that traders said likely foreshadowed a steep increase in grains export tariffs. MARKET NEWS * The yen and the euro rose against the dollar on growing expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve will cut interest rates at its policy review this month to protect the economy from the rapid spread of the virus. * Oil prices pared losses after earlier hitting multi-year lows as hopes that a bigger-than-expected production cut from OPEC and stimulus from central banks could offset economic gloom from the virus outbreak. * U.S. stock index futures tumbled as trading reopened on Sunday night with investors still unnerved by the coronavirus and taking little solace from weekend comments by U.S. officials that aimed to soothe panic about a pandemic.
