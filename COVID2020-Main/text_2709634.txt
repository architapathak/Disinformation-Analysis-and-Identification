March 5 (Reuters) - Twitter Incâ€™s Chief Executive Officer Jack Dorsey said on Thursday he is reconsidering a planned trip to Africa this year in light of concerns related to the coronavirus outbreak. Dorsey tweeted in November, as he was wrapping up a tour of the continent, that he was planning to move there for three to six months in mid-2020. The tweet raised concerns among investors over how he would run Twitter and Square, the other company he leads.
