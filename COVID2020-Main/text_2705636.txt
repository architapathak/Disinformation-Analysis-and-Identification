Dear @realDonaldTrump: Please stop misleading the American people about #coronavirus. Your own @NIH expert Dr. Fauci said the death rate is about 2%. Washington State deaths suggest for certain populations the death rate is even higher.STOP MAKING STUFF UP. LIVES ARE AT STAKE. https://t.co/sJAKPZEmkx Dear @realDonaldTrump: Hereâ€™s the problem with what you are saying. People with mild or moderate symptoms can infect others, who may get more severe symptoms, or in certain cases, die. This is why we need to sufficiently test people, which your Administration failed to do. https://t.co/z12ZsxOti5
