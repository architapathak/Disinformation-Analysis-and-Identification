BEIJING, March 5 (Reuters) - Sales in China’s consumer market stabilized in late February as people gradually returned to work after efforts to curb the coronavirus outbreak had succeeded in some places, Wang Bin, Deputy Director of the Department of Market Operation and Consumption at the Ministry of Commerce said on Thursday.
