Anxieties surrounding the rise of the coronavirus seem to be at an all-time high. So much so, that people are swarming online retailers to snatch up all the hand sanitizer and N95 masks they can. Because of this, retailers are basically a wasteland when it comes to survival gear. (Also, stop hoarding all this stuff, you don't really need it unless you're sick or an actual medical professional.) We don't want to feed into the panic and tell you that the world is ending, because it's not. But, we also aren't going to tell you that it's a bad idea to be prepared in case of emergencies — whether that's an epidemic-fueled quarantine or lack of power caused by a storm. When building (or buying) an emergency kit, here's a basic idea of what it should include, according to Ready.gov: Water: It's a good idea to have one gallon of water per person per day for at least three days Food: At least a three-day supply of non-perishable food Battery-powered or hand crank radio and a NOAA Weather Radio with tone alert Flashlight First aid kit Extra batteries Whistle to signal for help Moist towelettes, garbage bags, and plastic ties Manual can opener for food Local maps Cell phone with chargers and a backup battery See a more expanded list right here. It's worth noting that in the event of a quarantine, you'd want a water and non-perishable food supply that can last more like two weeks, a ready supply of prescription and often-used over-the-counter drugs, plus plenty of things to do to stave off any boredom.

Though it's hard to find a decent, pre-assembled emergency kit on Amazon right now — many of them are sold out with no indication of when they'll be restocked — we were able to scrape together a few that should quell your fears at least a little bit.  Here's what's actually in stock on Amazon — just try to limit yourself to buying one if you really want to and give others the opportunity to be prepared too.  This one is small and easy to store around your home. Inside you'll find food rations, drinking water, blankets, safety light sticks, a small first aid kit, a whistle, and more.
