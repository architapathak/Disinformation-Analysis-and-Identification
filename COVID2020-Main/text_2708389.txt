March 4 (Reuters) - Twitter Inc said on Wednesday it would stop any attempt by advertisers to use the coronavirus outbreak to send inappropriate advertisements to its users. Government entities seeking to spread public health information will be allowed to promote epidemic-related ads, Twitter said.
