The death toll of the novel coronavirus that originated in Wuhan, China, is now more than 3,000, and the virus has infected more than 90,000 people worldwide, most of them in China. The US now has nearly 100 reported casesOn January 30, the World Health Organization (WHO) officially declared it a global health emergency. The virus has disrupted travel worldwide, leading to flight cancellations, quarantines, and other breakdowns in movement. The virus has spread to 60 countries and is now on every continent except Antarctica. Some experts have said it could become a permanent virus that humans face, akin to the seasonal flu, though health officials have stopped short of calling it a pandemic.Dating app Tinder gave users some advice about how to stay safe, linking back to WHO, which popped up while swiping through potential matches. The message, which says "Your wellbeing is our #1 priority," doesn't get prime placement in the app. It took several minutes of consistent swiping through probably dozens of people before the message finally appeared. 













Tinder's advice is consistent with what the CDC suggests: good hand hygiene, avoiding touching your face, keep your distance from sick people.















Some people pointed out that they have more pressing concerns on Tinder.

While the information might be helpful for some, others want Tinder to be a respite from constant updates on COVID-19.
