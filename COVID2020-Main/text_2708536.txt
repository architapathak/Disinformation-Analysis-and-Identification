TOKYO, March 4 (Reuters) - Takeda Pharmaceutical Co said on Wednesday it is working on a drug that is aimed at treating people infected with the coronavirus. Japanese drug maker will make an announcement on this on Wednesday, a Takeda spokeswoman said, without elaborating. Takeda is trying to develop a drug to treat people infected with the novel coronavirus or at high risk of contracting it, the Wall Street Journal reported earlier in the day. The companyâ€™s experimental drug would be derived from the blood of coronavirus patients who have recovered from the respiratory disease, the paper said, citing company officials.
