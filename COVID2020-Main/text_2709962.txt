NEW YORK, March 5 (Reuters) - U.S. investors pulled slightly more than a net $20.3 billion out of equity mutual funds and exchanged-traded funds during the week ending Wednesday, according to data released Thursday by Refinitivâ€™s Lipper division. The declines came amid spiking market volatility as companies and investors try to gauge the potential economic impact of the coronavirus known as COVID-19. The benchmark S&P 500 is now down nearly 7% for the year to date after touching record highs on Feb. 19. Investors have pulled a net of nearly $42.4 billion out of equity funds over the last two weeks, the sharpest pullback from the stock market since the nearly $81 billion net assets lost during the two weeks that ended on Dec. 19, 2018. Money market funds, meanwhile, pulled in a net of nearly $38.5 billion, the largest one-week inflow since mid-December. (Reporting by David Randall Editing by Nick Zieminski)
