Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden criticized President Donald Trump's reaction to the coronavirus outbreak, using it as a rebuke to the president's derision toward the former vice president's ability to lead. "This is a guy who doesn't know what he's doing," Biden said on “Fox News Sunday“ to host Chris Wallace. "He doesn't know how to run the country; he is making us more unsafe the way he is responding to the coronavirus. He has done virtually nothing well that I can see." Biden's remarks come after he gained a much-needed victory in the South Carolina primary and as the administration works to straighten its messaging on the growing global heath threat. The first reported U.S. death to coronavirus occurred Saturday in Washington state, and the Trump administration announced the release of testing kits for thousands of patients to prepare for a possible outbreak in the country. Trump's response to the health crisis has garnered criticism, particularly the way he used the outbreak as a political point to shoot down his Democratic foes.  Biden's comment was a rebuke to Trump claiming earlier over the weekend that were Biden to win, he would not "be running the government." "He's just going to be sitting at a home someplace," Trump added. "People are going to be running it for him." Biden said he is eager to debate the president to show his ability to lead and that he has the energy to be president. "I want people to see me standing next to him and him standing next to me. We will see who is sleepy," Biden said, alluding to Trump's frequent insult of "Sleepy Joe Biden."
