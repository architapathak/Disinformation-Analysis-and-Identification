The CDC today abruptly postponed a press briefing on the coronavirus response. CDC spokesperson Ben Haynes told reporters on the scheduled call that it had been pushed back and did not provide an explanation as to why or when it would be rescheduled. A White House spokesperson later said the CDC would participate in an afternoon briefing today on the coronavirus response with Vice President Mike Pence. The postponement of the briefing comes after a number of states reported new cases over the weekend and federal officials confirmed the countryâ€™s first and second deaths from the virus. CDC has been holding sporadic telephone briefings with reporters, including a call on Saturday after the first death in the U.S. was announced. CDC Director Robert Redfield told POLITICO last week that his agency intended to continue holding the calls and briefing the press as the coronavirus response evolves. The CDC today also removed information on its website that detailed how many people in the country had been tested for the virus. It now only displays the number of confirmed cases. CDC has not yet responded to a request for comment. Forty-three people in the U.S. have tested positive for the virus so far, including at least half a dozen people in Washington state who became infected at a long-term care facility.
