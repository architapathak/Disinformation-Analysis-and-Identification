NEW YORK, March 2 (Reuters) - Colombia's state-run oil company Ecopetrol SA placed restrictions on business travel to all Asian and European countries on Monday, its chief executive told Reuters, in response to the coronavirus outbreak. The company is closely monitoring the effects of virus on crude demand and China has not cut back purchases of its crude yet, Chief Executive Felipe Bayon said in an interview with Reuters in New York. World Health Organization (WHO) chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said almost eight times as many cases had been reported outside China as inside in the previous 24 hours, adding the risk of coronavirus spreading was now very high at a global level.
