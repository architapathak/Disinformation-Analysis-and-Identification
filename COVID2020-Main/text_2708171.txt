SEOUL, March 5 (Reuters) - South Korea’s top refiner SK Energy will reduce its crude distillation units’ run rates by 10-15% in March as exports and domestic demand have been hit by the impact of the coronavirus outbreak, a company spokesman said. SK Energy, owned by SK Innovation, runs five crude distillation units with a total refining capacity of 840,000 barrels-per-day in the southeastern city of Ulsan.
