LONDON, March 2 (Reuters) - Global central banks have held talks about the impact of the coronavirus outbreak, European Central Bank Vice President Luis de Guindos said on Monday, adding that such discussions always take place during times of volatility. De Guindos said that he did not expect the euro to move sharply as part of this increased market turbulence. The ECB does not have an exchange rate target, he said. "My impression is that it is not going to move much and that it is going to hover around $1.10," he said. (Reporting by Marc Jones; Writing by Balazs Koranyi; Editing by Alison Williams)
