A disgruntled former security guard held dozens of people hostage in a mall in the Philippines on Monday. Afterwards he told journalists exactly why he'd done it in a bizarre press conference.Archie Paray, 31, was recently fired from V-Mall in San Juan City, Manila, after failing to show up for work after security guards' shifts were changed. On Monday, he entered his former workplace, shot another security guard, then took up to 70 people hostage.The mall was evacuated. Police and SWAT promptly arrived. The situation was taken seriously. Authorities wanted to avoid a repeat of several other deadly attacks in the Philippines in recent years.For 10 hours, Paray communicated with the authorities and the media. He showed both the hostages and a grenade, via a video call. Police haven't confirmed he had a real grenade.By the evening, all of the hostages were released unharmed. But what was unusual was that after releasing the hostages Paray was given a chance — 20 minutes — to voice his concerns to the media. He took journalists' questions and alleged that the mall's security was corrupt. He was then tackled by police and taken into custody.


Here's how it happened, in photos.













At about 10 a.m. on Monday morning, a former security guard named Archie Paray opened fire in V-Mall in San Juan City, based in the Philippine capital of Manila.

Paray shot a security guard, who was taken to hospital and is now in stable condition. Then, he entered administrative offices on the second floor, and took between 30 and 70 people hostage. They were mostly employees.

Other people in the mall heard the shots and evacuated. Hundreds of shoppers and employees managed to get out. Police closed the mall off.

In the Philippines, malls are a community center, filled with food courts, shopping, medical centers, and churches, according to Al Jazeera.

While hostage events aren't common in the Philippines, in 2010, a disgruntled former policeman took over a busload of tourists from Hong Kong, and died in a gunfight along with eight civilians.

More recently, in 2017, a gunman entered a mall-casino also in Manila. He set gambling tables alight, which killed 36 people, primarily from smoke inhalation.

The authorities did not want a repeat of either of these tragedies.











 






While the entrances were all closed, people gathered outside the mall, waiting to see what would happen.















Relatives of the hostages arrived, too. As the day went on, more information became available.

Mayor Francis Zamora of San Juan City explained to reporters that Paray "felt bad because he was removed as a guard." Zamora also said he had called for his former co-workers to join him, but no one did.

Throughout the day, journalists and officials had a direct connection to Paray, via his walkie-talkie and a video call.

The video showed what he claimed was a live grenade, but there's been no confirmation it was real.

He also showed the hostages on the video call. He told reporters, "Just wait, they will come out alive."

Even so, the authorities spent hours on the phone with Paray, asking for him to give up the hostages. In the early evening, in an attempt to appease him, six of the officers, who ran the mall's security, apologized and resigned, or offered to resign.

Paray said he would release the hostages as long as no one tried to trick him. After his safety was guaranteed, he kept his word. In the evening, the hostages filed out.

Then, instead of being bundled into a van and taken to prison, Paray led an impromptu news conference for 20 minutes.

He accused the mall's security guard roster of corruption, and that he was the "fall guy," according to The New York Times.

He took questions from reporters.











 






But when he reached for something in his waist band, police descended on him, tackling him to the ground.

He was subdued.











 






Police took him away.















It was an unusual ending to a hostage situation. Mayor Zamora told reporters, "What is important is that we had zero casualties. That was what we wanted. That the hostages can all go out safe."
