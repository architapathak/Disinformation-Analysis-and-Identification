March 5 (Reuters) - The first two cases of coronavirus have been confirmed in Harris County, Texas, public health officials there said on Thursday, in a man and woman from an unincorporated area north of Houston. The two cases are believed to be travel-related, the Harris County Public Health department said in a written statement, and there is no evidence of community spread. Nearby Fort Bend County reported a presumptive positive case on Wednesday. (Reporting by Dan Whitcomb; Editing by Sandra Maler)
