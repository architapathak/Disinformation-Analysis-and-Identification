We are at #Costco. It’s a madhouse. Every cart has like survival essentials and the guy at guest services said every Costco in Hawaii is completely sold out of toilet paper. One guy is stocking up on margaritas and he’s who I really want to have nearby when #coronavirus hits.  People are posting these all over. I thought it was just the Costco near us. Also sold out are water, hand sanitizers, Lysol and Clorox wipes. Soon I’m sure all Targets and Walmart’s will be out of stuff. #panicbuying #coronavírus #igottheimportantstuff #alcohol A post shared by  Helen L (@yoonster1) on Feb 29, 2020 at 4:12pm PST
