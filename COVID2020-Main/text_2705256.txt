The Shop Safe Act would make companies liable for the sale of counterfeits that pose risks to human health and safety, and require online platforms to develop best practices to vet sellers and remove counterfeits as well as repeat counterfeit sellers. The bill would also make online marketplaces liable for sales of counterfeit goods by their third-party sellers if they don't take the necessary steps to stop such transactions, which would be a new risk for marketplaces.Online marketplaces may have to overhaul their business models if they become liable for the sale of counterfeit goods on their platforms.Many marketplaces have had third-party merchants sell counterfeit goods on their platforms in the past. Amazon's platform has featured counterfeit goods despite having a no-counterfeit policy. And considering that the Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that 20 of 47 items ordered from third-party merchants on "popular consumer websites" were counterfeit, the issue likely extends well beyond Amazon.This means many marketplaces would have to improve their anti-counterfeiting processes if the Shop Safe Act is passed, or they'd risk the potential costs of being held liable for the counterfeits some of their merchants sell.And platforms may have trouble effectively vetting their sellers because some boast thousands of merchants. For example, third-party sellers accounted for 58% of Amazon's physical gross merchandise sales in 2018 — worth $160 billion — showing that Amazon has a massive base of third-party sellers that it may have difficulty effectively managing in order to fight counterfeits and avoid liability issues.In addition to counterfeits, the e-commerce titan's platform has reportedly featured salvaged goods, items that were deemed unsafe by federal agencies, and spoiled food products, illustrating its struggles to manage its massive marketplace. So, large platforms like Amazon may have to be more selective about the sellers on their platforms in order to better check counterfeiting and avoid the risks of liability, limiting their selection, one of marketplaces' key advantages over first-party retailers.The coronavirus outbreak is highlighting how difficult it is for marketplaces to manage third-party sellers, potentially bringing more focus to the issue. Amazon, eBay, Etsy, and Walmart have been dealing with third-party merchants selling products that are said to help combat the coronavirus with misleading or unsubstantiated health claims, per CNBC.The platforms are removing such listings — Amazon has reportedly removed over 1 million products for such claims — but the coronavirus could showcase marketplaces' inability to fully control their platforms and build support for new liability rules.Want to read more stories like this one?
