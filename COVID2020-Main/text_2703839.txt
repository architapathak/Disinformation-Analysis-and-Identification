The White House’s National Economic Council is planning an interagency meeting Tuesday afternoon to discuss how the coronavirus is affecting the U.S. economy, according to two U.S. officials. One official said the meeting would cover possible economic responses to the virus, if the health situation were to warrant it, but a senior administration official downplayed the likelihood of policy proposals, saying the White House is simply convening a working group to monitor the economy. For his part, President Donald Trump has not proposed economic measures beyond calling on the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. “As usual, Jay Powell and the Federal Reserve are slow to act,” Trump tweeted this morning. “Germany and others are pumping money into their economies. Other Central Banks are much more aggressive. The U.S. should have, for all of the right reasons, the lowest Rate. We don’t, putting us at a competitive disadvantage. We should be leading, not following!” Financial ministers and central bankers of the Group of Seven major economies will hold a teleconference Tuesday morning to coordinate a response to the coronavirus outbreak.
