BEIJING, March 3 (Reuters) - China said on Tuesday that regions with good growing conditions should restore double-cropping of rice as part of its efforts to ensure food security amid ongoing measures to contain the spread of the coronavirus. A lockdown on movement of people in the virus epicentre of Hubei province has raised concerns about spring planting of key food crops such as rice. A central government group charged with managing the response to the virus said in a statement posted on the governmentâ€™s website that regions should try to expand the planted acreage of early crop rice.
