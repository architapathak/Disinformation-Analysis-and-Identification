WASHINGTON, March 4 (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives will vote on Wednesday on legislation to provide $8.3 billion in emergency funding to address the spreading coronavirus, said U.S. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer. Legislation funding emergency efforts to combat the disease would total $8.3 billion, including money to develop vaccines and tests for the disease, according to a House of Representativesâ€™ Democratic aide. The bipartisan legislation could be approved by the House as soon as Wednesday, paving the way for final action by the Senate this week. Reporting by David Morgan; writing by Diane Bartz; editing by
