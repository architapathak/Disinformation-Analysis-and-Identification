PARIS, March 4 (Reuters) - France will regulate the price of antibacterial gels after prices were reported to have increased heavily since the coronavirus outbreak began, Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said on Wednesday. A decree regulating the price would be published during the day, Le Maire told French BFM Business radio. A pharmacistsâ€™ union on Wednesday told franceinfo radio that the price rise was unacceptable, and called for government intervention.
