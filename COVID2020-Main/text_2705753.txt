James Corden is a man of many faces. In Carpool Karaoke he's upbeat and bubbly; during his audience Q&As he's outraged and indignant; and while playing the celebrity cell phone guessing game in the video above, he's just very, very intense. The rules are simple enough: based only on a recent song, a text and a photo, Corden must try and work out which celebrity's phone he's looking at — Martin Freeman's, Pete Holmes', or Bad Bunny's. Poor old Freeman seems to get the worst of the grilling, and he's the one Corden eventually ends up guessing — but once again, The Late Show host gets it wrong.
