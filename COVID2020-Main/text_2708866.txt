TOKYO (Reuters) - Olympics Minister Seiko Hashimoto said on Thursday that Japan was still preparing for the Summer Games as planned, after earlier this week raising the topic of postponement amid the coronavirus outbreak. “Cancellation or delay of the Games would be unacceptable for the athletes,” Hashimoto said before the Upper House budget committee. “An environment where athletes can feel at ease and focus should be firmly prepared,” she said. Hashimoto added that organizers and the International Olympic Committee would continue to work together closely. Reporting by Chris Gallagher and Kevin Buckland; Editing by Christian Schmollinger
