Schools in Italy will close through March 15 to address the country’s coronavirus outbreak, the worst in Europe, Education Minister Lucia Azzolina announced Wednesday. "I hope pupils can return to school as soon as possible,” Azzolina said. The nation’s death toll from the virus has reached 107, with 28 deaths in the past 24 hours, NBC reported, citing the country’s Civil Protection Agency. In all, 3,090 cases have been confirmed in Italy. The majority of cases in Italy have been concentrated in its northern regions, with 1,520 cases in Lombardy, 307 in Veneto and 520 in Emilia-Romagna. As of Wednesday, Valle D’Aosta is the only one of Italy's 20 regions that had not recorded a case, CNBC reported. Meanwhile, national health authorities said Tuesday they are considering developing a new quarantine “red zone” northeast of Milan. “None of us can be sure about the future evolution of the disease. This is an important week to understand what will happen,” Angelo Borrelli, head of the Civil Protection Agency, told a news conference Tuesday. The government has already developed such zones in Lombardy and Zeneto and has also developed “yellow zones” that allow free movement but where numerous public spaces such as bars, restaurants, schools and sports venues are closed.
