MOSCOW, March 5 (Reuters) - Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak told reporters in Moscow on Thursday that he expects to be back in Vienna on Friday for talks with the OPEC and other oil producers, a group known as OPEC+. Novak declined to comment on Russia’s position ahead of the meeting. He was due to attend a regular cabinet meeting in Moscow on Thursday. Saudi Arabia and other OPEC members struggled on Wednesday to win Russia’s support for additional oil output cuts in a bid to prop up oil prices, which have tumbled by a fifth this year because of the impact of the coronavirus outbreak.
