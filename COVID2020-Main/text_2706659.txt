PARIS (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron canceled two scheduled events this week to focus on France’s response to the coronavirus crisis, his office said on Monday. A visit to southwestern France on Wednesday was postponed while his attendance at the Jewish group CRIF’s annual dinner on Tuesday was canceled. “It doesn’t mean the president is self-isolating, this is to make sure he is available to manage the situation,” the official said.
