"The Trump era has turned all of us into cats trying to follow multiple laser pointers at once," Late Night host Seth Meyers quipped during Monday's episode. Between the Democratic primary and spreading coronavirus concerns, there's an awful lot to pay attention to right now.  Yet, as always, Trump continues to unevenly tan himself under the spotlight. Once again making it all about him, Trump and his fellow Republicans have dismissed criticism of the administration's coronavirus response as a Democratic ploy to bring him down.  As a reminder, said response involved Trump stating that "in theory when it gets a little warmer it miraculously goes away." "Where did you get this idea that it just goes away in April? Are you confusing it with Lent?" asked Meyers, before launching into an imitation of Trump. "'You know it starts in February and it usually goes away in April but you have to give something up to avoid catching it. I'm giving up flag humping.'" This, of course, was a reference to the "super weird fact" that Trump literally hugged and kissed the American flag on Saturday. The U.S. continues to catapult itself headlong into self-parody. "Believe me, we could spend a whole 10 minutes on that," said Meyers. "If Trump's not careful he's going to have to pay hush money to Betsy Ross."
