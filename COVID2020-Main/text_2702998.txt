With the coronavirus continuing to spread, John Oliver used Sunday's edition of Last Week Tonight to take a close look at the disease — breaking down everything from the global and political reaction (including Trump's troubling down-playing and swift press conference exit), to the precautions viewers should be taking. "At this point, you may be wondering, how scared should you be?" says Oliver. "And the answer is probably: a bit. A bit. Look, I don't want to be alarmist here, but I also don't want to minimise what we could be facing. It's really about trying to strike a sensible balance." Coronavirus, officially known as COVID-19, has now killed more than 3,000 people globally. To finish the segment, Oliver offers some practical steps everyone should be taking — from not hoarding face masks to following advice on the CDC website.
