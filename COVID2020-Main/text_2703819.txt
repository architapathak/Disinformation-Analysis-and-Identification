Vice President Mike Pence will speak to both Republican and Democratic senators Tuesday about the coronavirus at their weekly lunches, according to his spokesperson and a senior Democratic aide.  The vice president’s visit to the Hill comes as Congress is getting ready to introduce a multi-billion dollar supplemental package to respond to the coronavirus. Congressional appropriators are finalizing an emergency package that will likely provide about $7 billion to $8 billion, according to a source familiar with the talks.  “Senate Democrats are looking forward to the opportunity to directly press Vice President Pence about the Trump Administration’s efforts to combat the coronavirus and keep Americans safe,” said a senior Democratic aide. Trump tapped Pence to lead the administration's task force dedicated to the coronavirus.  The House is expected to vote on the measure this week, with the Senate likely following suit next week.  Over the weekend, authorities in Washington State announced two coronavirus-related deaths — the first two fatalities reported in the nation. Meanwhile, several states including Rhode Island, Florida, Illinois and New York are reporting new cases.  Caitlin Emma contributed to this report.
