Health officials on Monday confirmed four additional coronavirus deaths in Washington, bringing the state's total death toll to six. There are 18 confirmed cases in Washington, including the six deaths. Nationwide, 96 cases have been confirmed, including in individuals who have been repatriated from the Diamond Princess cruise ship. Some patients haven't had any known contact with the virus and haven't been traveling to countries where there are outbreaks, leading officials to believe it is spreading within communities. There have been nearly 89,000 cases of the coronavirus globally, including more than 8,700 outside of China, where it was first detected. The virus has hit 64 countries and the World Health Organization said the global risk of the virus is "very high." --Updated at 3:45 p.m. View the discussion thread.
