Though Elizabeth Warren and Tulsi Gabbard are still technically running, Super Tuesday effectively narrowed the race for the Democratic nomination down to Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders. As Late Night host Seth Meyers noted during Wednesday's episode, many pundits and voters have now latched on to the question of which man is the most "electable." "Honestly, it's insane that we're still talking about electability three years into the presidency of the least electable person in the history of elections," said Meyers. "Donald Trump is like a lab experiment where a bunch of scientists got together and tried to create the most unelectable candidate possible." "The point is we have no way of knowing who's the most electable â€” just vote for whoever you think would make the best president." Meanwhile across the aisle, Trump has continued to Trump, blaming the government's slow response to the coronavirus on former president Barack Obama. Obama has not held office for three years, but that seems to be no obstacle for Trump to use him as a scapegoat once again. "He actually did it, he found a way to blame the coronavirus on Barack Obama," quipped Meyers.
