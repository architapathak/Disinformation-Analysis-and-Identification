March 2 (Reuters) - Currency service provider Travelex on Monday estimated a 25 million pounds ($31.9 million) hit to first-quarter underlying core earnings due to the ransomware attack in late December, and said it has restored all its customer-facing systems. The company, owned by UK-listed Finablr, said the coronavirus outbreak is another negative for its business due to broad exposure to airports and travel demand.
