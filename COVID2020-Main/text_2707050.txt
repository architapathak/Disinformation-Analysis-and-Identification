The event, which was scheduled for April 24-26, will issue refunds to all fans who purchased tickets to the Curtis Culwell Center in Dallas. “At Psyonix, we take the safety of our competitive players, fans, and personnel very seriously,” Psyonix wrote on the Rocket League official website. “Due to worldwide health concerns surrounding the developing situation around the Coronavirus (COVID-19), we are cancelling the Rocket League Season 9 World Championship live event as scheduled from April 24-26 in Dallas, Texas. “We understand that this is frustrating, but health and safety will always be our top priority.” The regular season of the Rocket League Championship Series will be resuming play with no scheduling changes.
