SEOUL, March 6 (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics suspended operations at its smartphone factory in South Korea’s southeastern city of Gumi again on Friday after another worker tested positive for coronavirus, a spokeswoman said. The plant will resume production on Saturday, she said. So far, six people who work at the factory complex in Gumi, which makes Samsung’s premium G20 smartphones and Z Flip foldable phones, have contracted the disease, leading to temporary shutdowns. It temporarily closed the factory last month due to the virus. (Reporting by Hyunjoo Jin; Editing by Susan Fenton)
