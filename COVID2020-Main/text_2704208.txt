The emergency proclamation includes anti-price gouging provisions as well as provisions allowing for health care workers to travel from out of state to provide assistance in health care facilities. It comes the day after Newsom announced the release of millions of N95 masks amid shortages caused by the virus. California has confirmed 53 cases of the virus as of Wednesday afternoon. Officials have said their "preliminary understanding" is that the patient who died Wednesday had "minimal community exposure" between the cruise and his hospitalization. The death was reported as Washington state confirmed its 10th coronavirus death, with the total number of confirmed cases at 39 as of Wednesday. Nine of the deaths occurred in King County.
