San Francisco authorities have confirmed the first two coronavirus cases in the city, Mayor London Breed announced in a news conference on Thursday."Today we are announcing the first two cases of coronavirus in our city," Breed said. "These individuals are contained ... and I want to be clear that we have been planning this for weeks, and so we are prepared as a city."Breed declared a citywide state of emergency last week.One patient is a man in his 90s who's in "serious condition," while the other is a woman in her 40s in "fair condition," Colfax said.The two patients' results were communicated to the city on Thursday morning, said Grant Colfax, San Francisco's public health director. They are being treated in isolation at two San Francisco hospitals.


Neither had traveled to a location with confirmed coronavirus cases or had contact with a person confirmed to have COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus, Colfax said. It appears they contracted the illness through community transmission in San Francisco, he added."We do not know at this point how they were exposed to the virus, which suggests it is spreading in the community. We expected that to happen," Colfax said.
