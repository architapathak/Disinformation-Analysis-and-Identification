John Mulaney took advantage of his third time on the Saturday Night Live hosting stage to... work out some material. I haven't seen Mulaney's recent stand-up, so maybe he's recycling some things here. But where lots of SNL hosts have a carefully engineered monologue featuring guests and choreography, Mulaney's latest one is just him doing a little comedy. It's very funny. Mulaney jokes about boomer dads and Roman senators stabbing Julius Caesar. It's clear he's performing his own material and the monologue is all the better for it.
