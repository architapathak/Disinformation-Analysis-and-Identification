(Adds delay of another conference, details) DUBAI, March 2 (Reuters) - Bahrain has postponed two oil and gas conferences which were scheduled to take place this month, including a regional gathering for oil traders, due to the coronavirus outbreak. The annual Middle East Petroleum and Gas Conference (MPGC), at which the regionâ€™s oil traders meet, has been postponed to the second half of the year due to travel restrictions and health concerns, the organisers said on Monday. Another energy conference, GEO 2020, which was due to be held on March 16-19, was postponed until Sept. 14-17. Gulf oil ministers and senior oil officials were due to speak at both conferences. Bahrain has reported 47 cases of the coronavirus infection. Airlines have been suspending flights or modifying services in response to the coronavirus outbreak, as more cases were reported around the globe. Concerns prompted organisers to cancel one of highest-profile gatherings of oil ministers and top executives from the energy and financial industries scheduled this month in Houston.
