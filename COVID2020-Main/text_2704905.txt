The top U.S. airlines trade group and CEOs from several passenger companies are set to meet with Vice President Pence on Wednesday to discuss the coronavirus outbreak. Airlines for America (A4A) said it plans to discuss efforts to help the government address the virus spread. Pence mentioned the forthcoming meeting at Tuesday's White House briefing and said they would be talking about “contact tracing data.” “We commend President TrumpDonald John TrumpAs Biden surges, GOP Ukraine probe moves to the forefront Republicans, rooting for Sanders, see Biden wins as setback Trump says Biden Ukraine dealings will be a 'major' campaign issue MORE’s decisive action to appoint Vice President Pence to head the Administration’s continued strong leadership during this public health crisis,” A4A President and CEO Nicholas Calio said in a statement. “We appreciate the opportunity to meet with the Vice President and his senior team to discuss with them pragmatic, effective solutions that further our shared goal of protecting the health, safety and well-being of travelers.” A4A said it has offered to pay for a website and app to get accurate contact data for passengers. The airline industry has been in the spotlight since the outbreak. Major carriers, including Jet Blue, Alaska Airlines, American Airlines and Delta Air Lines, have taken steps to help with containment by announcing they would waive ticket change and cancellation fees for passengers amid the scare. There have been nine deaths in the U.S. from the virus and at least 108 confirmed cases. World Health Organization officials announced Tuesday that about 3.4 percent of reported coronavirus cases globally have resulted in death. Morgan Chalfant contributed. View the discussion thread.
