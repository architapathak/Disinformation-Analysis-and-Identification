MANILA, March 6 (Reuters) - The Asian Development Bank (ADB) said on Friday the coronavirus outbreak is set to trim global and developing Asiaâ€™s economic growth this year. The outbreak could slash global gross domestic product by 0.1 to 0.4% while economic growth in China and developing Asia, excluding China, could be trimmed by 0.3 to 1.7% and 0.2 to 0.5%, respectively, the ADB said in an analysis that outlined best and worst case scenarios.
