March 1 (Reuters) - The Sampdoria v Verona Serie A match due to be played on Monday has been postponed until May 13, the Italian top-flight league said on Sunday. Its statement was issued shortly after the president of the Liguria region said the match, to be played in Genoaâ€™s Luigi Ferraris stadium, could only go ahead if it was played behind closed doors because of the coronavirus. It is the sixth out of 10 Serie A matches scheduled to take place between Saturday and Monday that has been called off. Writing by Brian Homewood; Editing by Ken Ferris
