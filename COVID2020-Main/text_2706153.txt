A global coronavirus outbreak has killed thousands and put world leaders on edge. But President Donald Trump is sharing dank memes. Lest anyone forget that we live in the weirdest timeline, Trump retweeted a strange video of him owning the libs on Sunday night, just hours after officials confirmed the second American death from the virus and the first case in New York City. The two-minute clip is catnip for a pro-Trump internet shaped by irony and snark. It belittles the president’s political opponents, takes aim at critical journalists, and plays into the MAGA cult of personality. Trump shared the propaganda as he continues to downplay the coronavirus threat. He’s portrayed Democrats’ concern about the disease — which has killed more than 3,000 and now threatens a U.S. landfall — as a hoax. And news outlets’ reporting on his administration’s response has highlighted confusion and misinformation at the top. Trump isn’t doing much to allay fears that he’s not taking the potential for a pandemic seriously. As global markets plummeted amid public health concerns last week, the president spent 45 minutes meeting with actors in a play about the so-called Deep State. The bizarro content he shared Sunday night, originally made last year, has since been viewed at least 1.1 million times. It shows a smiling Trump strutting past a weird array of cartoonish imagery showing his opponents, accomplishments, and random bits of Americana: Cover: President Donald Trump hugs the flag of the United States of America at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) at Gaylord National Resort & Convention Center on February 29, 2020 in National Harbor, Maryland.
