SHANGHAI (Reuters) - A total of 78 million Chinese migrant rural workers have already returned to work, accounting for 60% of the total who left for home for the Chinese New Year holiday, a government official said on Saturday, as Beijing steps up measures to limit the disruption to businesses from the coronavirus outbreak. But Chinese officials told a press briefing that the risk of contagion from increased population flows is rising, and the country will continue efforts to contain the virus spread.
