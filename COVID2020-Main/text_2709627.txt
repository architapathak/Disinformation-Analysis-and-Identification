MADRID, March 5 (Reuters) - Ten residents of a Madrid nursing home and a health worker have tested positive for coronavirus, the region’s social affairs authority said on Thursday. Tests will be carried out on the rest of the residents at the La Paz home, while all planned activities have been suspended in an effort to limit infection, the authority said in a statement. Preventative measures, such as setting up isolation zones and barring people with symptoms from communal areas, will be rolled out across the city’s network of care homes. Madrid has emerged as the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak in Spain, with 90 cases out of 234 across the country, according to figures from the health ministry. Three people have died of the coronavirus in the southern European country. (Reporting by Nathan Allen; Editing by Ingrid Melander and Angus MacSwan)
