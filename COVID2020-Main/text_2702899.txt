(Adds details, table) LONDON, March 3 (Reuters) - Sainsbury's was the only one of Britain's "big four" supermarkets to record year-on-year sales growth in the 12 weeks to Feb. 23, although it still lost market share to discounters Aldi and Lidl, according to researchers Kantar. Sales at Sainsbury's rose 0.3%, Kantar said on Tuesday, whereas market leader Tesco recorded a dip of 0.8%, Asda was down 1.2% and Morrisons fell 2.0%.

Its bigger rival Aldi recorded growth of 5.7%, giving it a 7.9% market share. The impact of the coronavirus crisis has been seen at the tills, with sales of hand sanitiser up 255% in February while liquid soaps grew by 7%, Kantar said.
