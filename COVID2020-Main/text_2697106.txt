March 1 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures tumbled when trading reopened on Sunday night with investors still unnerved by coronavirus and taking little solace from weekend comments by U.S. officials that aimed to soothe panic about a pandemic. Senior officials in President Donald Trump’s administration on Sunday tried to reduce concern about a global recession, saying the U.S. public had over-reacted and that stocks would rebound due to the American economy’s underlying strength. S&P 500 e-mini futures were down 1.6%, indicating a another bad day for the benchmark index on Monday after it fell more than 11% last week, its worst since the 2008 financial crisis.
