Late Night host Seth Meyers highlighted the lacklustre U.S. response to the coronavirus outbreak on Thursday, noting that while the CDC has tested just over 1,500 people, South Korea has tested over 90 times more. The country is also using a new drive-through model to do it, meaning patients don't even have to leave their cars. "Of course it should be a model for us!" said Meyers. "Look, we might be bad at stuff like health care, education, gun control, climate change, housing, criminal justice, and gender equality, but nobody is better than us at drive-throughs!"Â  Meyers further noted Trump is continuing to downplay and spread dangerous disinformation about the coronavirus. Speaking to Fox News on Wednesday, the U.S. president dismissed the World Health Organisation's official COVID-19 mortality rate of 3.4 percent based on his completely unsubstantiated "hunch," then shared his similarly baseless belief that it's perfectly fine for infected people to continue going to work. "So now he's telling people it's okay to go to work if they're sick," said Meyers. "This from a guy who doesn't even go to work when he's healthy."
