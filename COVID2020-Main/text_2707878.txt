(Corrects death toll to 32, not 34 in paragraph 2) SEOUL, March 4 (Reuters) - South Korea reported 516 new coronavirus cases on Wednesday, a day after a record spike in cases prompted the country’s president to declare a “war” on the fast spreading pathogen. The new cases bring South Korea’s total to 5,328, with 32 deaths, the worst epidemic of any nation outside China. On Tuesday President Moon Jae-in apologised for shortages of face masks and promised support for virus-hit small businesses in Asia’s fourth-biggest economy.
