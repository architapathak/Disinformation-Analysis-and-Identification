DUBAI, March 2 (Reuters) - Middle East airlines have lost an estimated $100 million so far due to the coronavirus outbreak and governments should help the carriers through this "difficult period", an official of the International Air Transport Association (IATA) said on Monday. Ticket sales in the region for Middle Eastern airlines are expected to drop in coming weeks and revenues are at risk if travel restrictions in Asia are extended, IATA Vice President for Africa and the Middle East Muhammad Ali Albakri told reporters. At this stage, global airlines stand to lose $1.5 billion this year due to the virus, he said. (Reporting by Alexander Cornwell; Writing by Aziz El Yaakoubi; Editing by Edmund Blair)
