STOCKHOLM, March 4 (Reuters) - The outbreak of the coronavirus will lower Swedish growth this year by around 0.3%, Finance Minister Magdalena Andersson said on Wednesday. Andersson said that global growth would likely be around 0.5% lower than it would otherwise have been without the impact of the coronavirus. In January, the government forecast gross domestic product would expand 1.1% this year. (Reporting by Stockholm Newsroom; editing by Niklas Pollard)
