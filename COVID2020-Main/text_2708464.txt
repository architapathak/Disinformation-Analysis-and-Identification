SYDNEY, March 5 (Reuters) - Australia’s Treasury Department estimates the coronavirus will detract at least half a percentage point off growth in the first quarter of 2020, but says it is too early to make a longer-term assessment of the impact of the virus. “At this stage we expect the virus to detract at last half a percentage point from growth in the March quarter 2020,” Treasury Secretary Steven Kennedy told a parliamentary committee in Canberra. “This preliminary estimate takes into account the direct impacts on tourism, international education exports and some exchange rate effects. It does not include supply-chain disruptions or other broader impacts.” The estimate is in line with an estimate made by the Reserve Bank of Australia.
