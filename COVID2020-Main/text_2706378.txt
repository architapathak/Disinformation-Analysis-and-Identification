The world stands transfixed by possible disaster and Elon Musk is here to offer his unsolicited opinion.  Calling to mind the infamous submarine stunt, the entitled billionaire chose today to lecture us all on a subject matter decidedly outside of his expertise. Yes, Musk weighed in on the coronavirus. "The coronavirus panic is dumb," wrote the man who, not so long ago, was fond of waxing philosophic about mixing wine and Ambien. The coronavirus panic is dumb — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 6, 2020 Of course, according to the World Health Organization, as of March 6 there are 98,192 confirmed cases of the virus and 3,380 confirmed deaths. The WHO notes that, among those exposed to the virus, "older persons and persons with pre-existing medical conditions... appear to develop serious illness more often than others." This, combined with the generally piss-poor state of testing in the U.S., has some people feeling a little, well, panicked. And that, according to Musk, is dumb.  Now, it's worth noting that as a billionaire Musk has health insurance and can afford whatever medical care he and his doctors deem appropriate. Last time we checked, the approximately 27 million Americans without health insurance don't have the same luxury. It's also worth noting, again, that Musk is neither an epidemiologist nor an infectious disease expert.  We'd imagine, however, that he is quite knowledgeable about his company Tesla. Speaking of which, Tesla's supply chain got screwed up and the company blamed the coronavirus. Huh, how about that. If we're all lucky, maybe Musk will put his considerable intelligence toward finding a submarine-shaped cure. Either way, we're sure to hear more coronavirus-related pablum from him on Twitter.
