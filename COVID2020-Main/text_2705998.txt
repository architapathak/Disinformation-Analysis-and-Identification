LeBron James says he'll be parking it if the NBA bans fans from the games amid growing fears of the coronavirus -- which might become a reality sooner than later. LBJ said it clear as day to reporters in the locker room Friday night after his and the Lakers' thunderous win over the Milwaukee Bucks in L.A. -- explaining it quite plainly like this, "We play games without the fans?
