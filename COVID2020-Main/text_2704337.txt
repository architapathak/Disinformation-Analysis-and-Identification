"The Democrats in the House should propose a very simple one year Payroll Tax cut," Trump tweeted late Monday. "Great for the middle class, great for the USA!" The Democrats in the House should propose a very simple one year Payroll Tax cut. Great for the middle class, great for the USA! The tweet comes amid concerns that the coronavirus will dampen the economy in an election year. Trump has been hoping to make the economy a key part of his reelection campaign, but a worsening economy due to the outbreak could be an obstacle to him winning a second term. Payroll tax cuts are considered an option for economic stimulus. Former President Obama enacted a temporary payroll tax cut during his presidency in an effort to help the middle class in the years following the Great Recession. A temporary payroll tax cut could help the middle class on a short-term basis. But it could also add to the debt and potentially hurt Social Security, which is financed through payroll taxes. This isn't the first time Trump has floated a payroll tax cut. Last summer, when there were signs that a recession could be on the horizon, the president said that the White House was looking at a payroll tax cut, but then quickly reversed himself.
