NEW YORK, March 3 (Reuters) - The New York Federal Reserve on Tuesday accepted $100 billion of the $108.608 billion in overnight bids from primary dealers in a repurchase agreement (repo) operation meant to keep the federal funds rate within the target range. The U.S. overnight repo rate on Tuesday was 1.8% before the repo operation, unchanged from Mondayâ€™s level. The overnight rate rose to 1.8% on Monday from 1.65% on Friday as dealers settled Treasury debt auctions and as concerns about the economic impact of the spread of the coronavirus spread.
