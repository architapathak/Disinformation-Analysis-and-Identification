MILAN, March 5 (Reuters) - Five Italian Serie A matches which were postponed between Feb 29 and March 2 because of the coronavirus outbreak, including the heavyweight clash between Juventus and Inter Milan, will take place on Sunday, the league said in a statement on Thursday. The matches will all be played without spectators following a government decree on Wednesday. The government has barred the public from all sports events until April 3 in a bid to curb Europeâ€™s worst coronavirus outbreak. The other matches are Parma v SPAL, AC Milan v Genoa, Sampdoria v Verona and Udinese v Fiorentina, while a sixth game, Sassuolo v Brescia, will be played on Monday. The 27th round of matches, due to be played this weekend, will be rescheduled to a future date. Second-placed Juventus are two points behind leaders Lazio with a game in hand while Inter are eight behind Lazio with two games in hand. Writing by Brian Homewood Editing by Toby Davis
