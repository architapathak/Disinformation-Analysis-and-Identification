Super Tuesday is a huge day in the calendar for the presidential primary election, in which a whopping 14 states vote for their Democrat or Republican of choice. At the time of writing, the results are still rolling in. Following the action as it unfolded was Trevor Noah, who hosted a live edition of The Daily Show in order to highlight the biggest headlines for the Democratic presidential candidates — from Joe Biden's resurgence to Michael Bloomberg's ongoing struggles. "It's looking like tonight is all about Joe Biden," Noah says in the video above. "Because black voters just put him over the top all across the south. In Virginia he won by 30 percent, and he's also been declared the winner in North Carolina, and in Alabama. "Right now, black people are embracing Biden so hard, I wouldn't be surprised if he rolls up to his next debate speech like, 'Wakanda for...you know the thing, you know the thing.'" Finally, Noah turned his attention to the candidates who didn't fare as well, including Bloomberg, who — despite spending millions — only managed to win American Samoa. "That's right folks, it looks like yet again, Bloomberg has come up short," Noah says. "I actually feel bad for this guy, man. Think about it, he came into this race with $60 billion and now he has what? $59.5 billion? I would not want to be him right now."
