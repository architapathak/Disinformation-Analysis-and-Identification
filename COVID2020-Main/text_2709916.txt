HONG KONG, March 2 (Reuters) - Hong Kong’s retail sales fell 21.4% in January from a year earlier, as the coronavirus outbreak discouraged tourists from visiting the Chinese-ruled city and kept citizens away from shopping centres. The health scare worsened an already weak environment for retail after months of often violent anti-government protests. For the month of January, sales dropped to HK$37.8 billion ($4.86 billion), government data showed on Monday, the 12th consecutive month of decline. December’s fall was a revised 19.4% In volume terms, retail sales in January fell 23.0%, compared with a revised 21.1% drop in December.
