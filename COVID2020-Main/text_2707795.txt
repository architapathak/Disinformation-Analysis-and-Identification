BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s yuan-denominated exports in January-February fell 15.9% from the same period a year earlier, customs data showed on Saturday, while imports slid 2.4% as a fast spreading coronavirus outbreak caused severe disruptions to manufacturing activity. That left China with a trade deficit of 42.59 billion yuan in the first two months of the year, according to Reuters calculations based on customs data. China did not release January trade figures alone. Customs said last month it would combine January and February preliminary trade data, in line with how some of the country’s other major economic indicators are released early in the year.
