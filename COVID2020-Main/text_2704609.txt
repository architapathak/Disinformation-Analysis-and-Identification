"Councilwoman CdeBaca made a sarcastic tweet on Twitter to call attention to the Trump administration’s downplaying of the coronavirus as a 'hoax,' no more dangerous than the common flu," the statement said, according to ABC affiliate Denver 7. "Rather than conservative outlets making a four-day-old tweet their focus on Super Tuesday, they should focus their energy on demanding a competent federal response to this public health crisis instead," her office added. The Colorado Republican Party called on CdeBaca to resign over the tweet. "There can be no room in our politics for wishing harm on Americans who have different political beliefs," Colorado Republican Party Executive Director Lx Fangonil said in a statement. "Democrats in Colorado and across the country need to condemn this evil statement."
