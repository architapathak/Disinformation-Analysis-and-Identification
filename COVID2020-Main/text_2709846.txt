LONDON (Reuters) - An HSBC employee in China has contracted the coronavirus, the bankâ€™s interim Chief Executive Noel Quinn told employees in an internal memo seen by Reuters, following news earlier on Thursday that the bank also had a case in London. Quinn has set up a senior team of business continuity and medical experts to brief him and other senior executives on the virus and its impact, he said in the memo. A spokeswoman for HSBC confirmed the contents of the memo. The bank earlier on Thursday sent home over 100 staff in London after a worker there tested positive for the coronavirus.
