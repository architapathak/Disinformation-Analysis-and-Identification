Pope FrancisPope FrancisPope tests negative for coronavirus: report Pope blames cold for skipping retreat Pope urges faithful to give up trolling on social media for Lent MORE reportedly said he will not be attending a spiritual retreat in the Roman countryside because he has a cold.  Francis, 83, made the announcement Sunday while speaking to pilgrims from a window above St. Peter’s Square, according to The Associated Press.  He reportedly paused twice to cough Sunday while speaking and asked for prayers for the spiritual retreat, adding “unfortunately a cold prevents me from participating this year. I will be following the meditation from here.” It was his first public appearance since Ash Wednesday when he was reportedly seen coughing and blowing his nose during mass.  As the coronavirus spreads across Italy, Vatican spokesman dismissed concerns that the pope was anything more than slightly unwell, according to Reuters,  “There is no evidence that would lead to diagnosing anything but a mild indisposition,” Bruni said Friday, according to Reuters.  More than 1,100 cases of coronavirus infection have been confirmed in Italy, the European country hardest-hit by the outbreak.
