LONDON, March 1 (Reuters) - Nigerian authorities have been in touch with around 100 people who may have been exposed to an Italian man who is the country’s first coronavirus patient, the Lagos state health commissioner said on Sunday. “It is around 100 people but that number is increasing every minute,” Akin Abayomi said in a telephone interview. He said some of the people had travelled to other states in Nigeria or gone to Europe. (Reporting by Alexis Akwagyiram; Editing by Mark Potter)
