VALLETTA (Reuters) - Malta’s first case of coronavirus has been detected in a 12-year-old Italian girl who lives on the island, Health Minister Chris Fearne said on Saturday. The girl tested positive for the illness early on Saturday and is receiving treatment in the infectious diseases unit of the state hospital, the minister said, adding she “is doing well”. She returned late last month from the northern Italian region of Trentino, passing through the capital Rome, with her parents and sister and reported symptoms on Friday.
