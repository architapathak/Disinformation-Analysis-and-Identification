Alongside interviewing Hollywood stars and dancing up a storm, Ellen DeGeneres is giving viewers a lesson on hand-washing in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak. "I like to keep you up to date on all the latest viral trends," the "Ellen" host told her audience in a Tuesday segment on her eponymous daytime talk show. "And there's a big one sweeping the world right now — it's not a good one — I'm talking about the coronavirus." Naming ways health officials have cited to prevent the spread of the deadly pandemic, DeGeneres said, "It turns out that a lot of people are not washing their hands properly." The 62-year-old comedian then went on to follow the World Health Organization's step-by-step guide to hand-washing. After lathering with soap and rubbing the back of her hands as directed, DeGeneres playfully told the audience that it's recommended to wash hands for at least 20 seconds. "Hit me up with a little 'Sexual Healing,' " DeGeneres said, as she dramatically scrubbed to the 1982 Marvin Gaye hit. DeGeneres isn't the only public figure to share a hand-washing tutorial.
