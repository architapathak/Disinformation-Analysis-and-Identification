This included the original documentary, "Beastie Boys Story" and the animated musical series "Central Park."Meanwhile, Netflix was set to screen films including "L.A. Originals" and run a panel with Kenya Barris and Rashida Jones on their upcoming sitcom series "Black Excellence."The duo joins the likes of Amazon, Facebook, and Twitter, who have all dropped out of SXSW in the past week.
