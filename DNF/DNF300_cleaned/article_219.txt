Donald Trump held a rally Wednesday night in the crucial battleground state of North Carolina, and as he spoke, one of his supporters held up a Hillary Clinton doll with a noose around its neck. 

The woman who hung the Democratic nominee in effigy said her name was Ginger Glover. Glover said she decided to hang the “Lyin’ Hillary” doll to show that Clinton should be “incarcerated, at the very least.” 

So does Glover wish harm on the former Secretary of State? She insisted she didn’t: “It’s just for effect.” 

One is left wondering why, if Glover thinks Clinton should be imprisoned, she didn’t dress the doll in an orange jumpsuit or prison stripes. Perhaps she’s simply not bright enough to have thought of doing so. 

In recent weeks, various disturbing and violent displays have shown up at Trump rallies: Earlier this week at a rally in Virginia Beach, Trump supporters took a model of Clinton’s head and mounted it on a stake. 

Also, at that same rally, reporters saw a poster which depicted a bull’s-eye superimposed over Clinton’s face. 

It should also be noted that a frequent chant heard at Trump rallies is the oft-repeated “Lock her up” refrain which was a feature of the GOP convention in Cleveland. Yet the Trump campaign always denies that their supporters are are the least bit violent or seeking confrontations with those who disagree with them.
