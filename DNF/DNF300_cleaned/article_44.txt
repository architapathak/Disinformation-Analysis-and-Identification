Well finally we have the big global Business/Bank Goldman Sachs officially endorsing Hillary Clinton for President !! They have been giving her money and paying for speeches for some time now. Get ready for Hillary's *actual* policies to kick in if and when she gets elected. Ironic. GS has been a target of political activism for years. Now they can bank on Hillary protecting them.  He’s with her. On Sunday, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton earned the endorsement of Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein—an endorsement she had been working toward for years. As was revealed by Wikileaks, Hillary Clinton spent the run up to her presidential campaign giving speeches to Goldman Sachs and other Wall Street banks, where she praised their talents and explained her positions on financial regulation. On October 24, 2013, Clinton told Goldman Sachs that Dodd-Frank had to be done mostly for “political reasons” because Congress needed to look like it was doing something about the crisis. She said, “There’s nothing magic about regulations, too much is bad, too little is bad. How do you get to the golden key, how do we figure out what works? And the people that know the industry better than anybody are the people who work in the industry.”
