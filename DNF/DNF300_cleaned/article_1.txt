The depths of raw deception and dishonesty routinely displayed by Hillary Clinton is nothing short of astonishing. Now we learn that she was wearing a covert earpiece during last night's town hall debate with Trump. The earpiece, clearly visible in the photo below, is a violation of debate rules, allowing Hillary to receive audio from another "handler" who tells her what to say. Actor James Woods tweeted a picture of the earpiece, point out, "She can't even #lie without help from a gaggle of other #liars through an earpiece." The obvious presence of this earpiece points to several huge revelations about Hillary Clinton and her failing campaign: 1) She is willing to lie, cheat and deceive to almost any degree in her bid for the White House. 2) Her campaign has no confidence in her ability to answer questions using her own brain. She must now be "handled" in real time in order to create the impression that she knows what she's talking about. 3) She has no respect for rules or laws of any kind. In the mind of Hillary Clinton, rules and laws do not apply to her, even though she and her supporters routinely invoke rules and laws to condemn and attack others.
