The attempt, of some type, occurred at 9 p.m. and caused a commotion throughout the crowed, just before Republican Presidential Nominee Donald J. Trump was rushed off stage by Secret Service. 

The suspect was removed and detained. 

“Nobody is going to stop this movement. Nobody,” a man said who took the mic during the chaos. 

“Trump, Trump, Trump […],” the crowed cheered. 

“Nobody said it was going to be easy for us, but we will never be stopped,” Trump said as he retook the stage minutes later to a cheering crowd. 

It was also reported that at least two people in the crowd ‘saw a gun.’
