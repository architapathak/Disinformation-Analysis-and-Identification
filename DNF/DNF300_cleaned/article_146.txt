In the summer of 2013, Hillary Clinton had just left the State Department and returned to New York. She was determined to latch on to her high approval ratings and lay the foundation for a second presidential run. That’s when Anthony D. Weiner happened. The husband of Clinton’s closest aide, Huma Abedin, was running for mayor of New York when it was revealed that he had continued to exchange lewd messages with women online even after the practice cost him his congressional seat. The incident brought Abedin’s relationship with Clinton into the spotlight, and Clinton was once again making headlines for sexual indiscretions. Now, just weeks away from the election, Weiner has pulled her into yet another one of his dramas. Federal investigators are looking into his sexual messaging with an underage girls, and they just happened to stumble across thousands of emails that are potentially pertinent to the FBI investigation of Clinton’s private email server. This was disturbing for many reasons. Americans are not happy that the Clintons have a continued behavior of standing behind those who have committed dangerous sexual or financial acts. That doesn’t align well with Hillary’s message about empowering women. In fact, many of Clinton’s friends have suggested she distance herself from Abedin. Still, she kept Abedin close by her side as she prepared to make a statement about the new revelation to the media. “We of course stand by her,” her campaign chairman, John D. Podesta, said on Saturday when he was asked whether Abedin would step down. The question on many Americans’ minds now is whether Clinton’s loyalty to Abedin would inspire her to bring her friend (and her drama) into the White House if she wins the presidency.
