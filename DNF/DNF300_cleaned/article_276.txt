While Hillary Clinton was en route to Cedar Rapids, Iowa for what ended up being a very uncomfortable campaign stop, she got some bad news. The FBI is taking another look at her emails — which could likely end her. Media rushed to the runway after her arrival, where cameras caught what she tried to hide outside her private airplane. 

The FBI announced that they are looking into Hillary’s previously undisclosed emails as she was mid-air and blissfully unaware and unable to prepare. Knowing what’s in those documents, she’s more aware of the ramifications than the rest of us, but because it was sprung on her, she wasn’t fully prepared for questions about it since she requires practiced answers that she receives ahead of time before talking to the public. 

However, forced to face the music upon landing, Hillary couldn’t escape the press pool waiting for her as she made a beeline for her getaway car from the airplane. That’s when she did something very telling of her guilt. 

Knowing that there was no way around the reporters, Hillary hid in Hill Force One with her advisors for about 30 minutes, who we can only imagine were calming the raging candidate down before she faced the public. Our guess is, she had a moment of meltdown with the news, screamed, yelled, and then was given a shot of her favorite liquor before exiting the aircraft, where she was met with a barrage of questions about the investigation. Rather than responding, which an innocent person would do, she flashed a fake smile and wave and didn’t say a single word. 

It would take too much explanation to lie, and she’d only further incriminate herself, so she gave the press the silent treatment instead, which actually spoke volumes. No matter how much Hillary ignores this, it’s not going away, as the truth will prevail against her and, hopefully, land her in the jailhouse — not the White House.
