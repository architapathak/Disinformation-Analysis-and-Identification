A Democratic presidential nominee – Hillary Clinton, who is by far the "establishment candidate" in this year's presidential race – wants to take over from another Democratic president, Barack Obama. She is promising to carry on his "successful" economic policies by promising to essentially double down on them .And yet, by any true measure, the economy has been a disaster under Obama. Real growth has nearly flat-lined , real unemployment figures – when a proper count is taken – is far higher than what is being "officially" posted by the administration , and 43 million Americans cannot get enough food without government assistance. In fact, on that last point and as reported by Natural Blaze , in the Obama economy, 1-in-6 Americans are going to bed hungry on most nights, if not every night. And Clinton wants to double down on Obama's economic policies? How can such a great economic recovery produce so many hungry Americans? For the past eight years, Americans have had to listen to lectures from Obama (and other Democrats) about how we, as a first-world nation, should be able to afford things like healthcare and offer a free college education to our citizens (and, increasingly, to non-citizens ). But shouldn't a nation that produces so much excess food each year that we export it to the tune of tens of billions of dollars be able to feed its people too? Of course. But malnutrition during the "great economic recovery" of the Obama years is rising at an alarming rate in the U.S. That's because in real terms, workers' wages are falling, and it is becoming more difficult for families and individuals to earn enough to put decent food on their tables."
