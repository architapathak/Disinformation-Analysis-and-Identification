An absolutely stunning Ministry of Finance ( MoF ) report circulating in the Kremlin today is expressing “outrage/anger” against the US Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) for its leaking to the New York Post some of the details relating to the disappearance of $20 million from a private Hillary Clinton charity that Federation banking regulators have determined was a bribe used by her to pay President Obama so that she could become the American Secretary of State. [Note: Some words and/or phrases appearing in quotes in this report are English language approximations of Russian words/phrases having no exact counterpart.]

According to this report, the practice of President Obama selling American government positions was first raised in 2013 by US diplomats who publically cried foul over this massive bribery scheme —and that hacked emails and documents proved was widespread, including bribes to become everything form ambassadors to assistant attorneys in the Justice Department .

To the largest known bribe to President Obama for a US government position though, this report continues, MoF banking regulators discovered in a Citibank Kazakhstan numbered (secret) account originally holding $20 million linked to the American leader by transfers made from it to his “personal/private” JPMorgan Chase account .

To how this discovery was made, this report notes, was through a MoF banking examination of the Republic of Kazakhstan who is seeking to join the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank ( AIIB ) that the Federation is the third largest shareholder in after China and India .

During the MoF’s examination of the Kazakhstan banking system on behalf of the AIIB, this report explains, a “mysterious/suspicious” numbered (secret) account (that originally held $20 million) was discovered at Citibank Kazakhstan in the name of a private American entity (not a non-profit) called the Haiti Development Fund LLC that was created by the Clinton Foundation criminal money laundering organization and was solely funded by Canadian mining mogul Frank Giustra and Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim with the money being “channeled/funneled” through the Clinton-Giustra Enterprise Partnership (Canada).
