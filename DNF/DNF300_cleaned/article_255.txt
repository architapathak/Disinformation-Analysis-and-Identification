Alex Jones breaks down the complete hypocrisy of Michele Obama and Hillary Clinton attacking Trump for comments he made over a decade ago while The White House is hosting and promoting rappers who boast about date raping women and selling drugs in their music. 

Rappers who have been welcomed to the White House by the Obama’s include “Rick Ross,” who promotes drugging and raping woman in his song “U.O.N.E.O.” 

While attacking Trump as a sexual predator, Michelle and Hillary have further mainstreamed the degradation of women through their support of so-called musicians who attempt to normalize rape.
