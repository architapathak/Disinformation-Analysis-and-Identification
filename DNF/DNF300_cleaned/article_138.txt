A San Diego Catholic Church claims Hillary is doing the devils work. Reuters reported: A Roman Catholic church in San Diego told its parishioners the devil works through politicians like Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and warned that voting for Democrats is a “mortal sin,” according to local media and the church’s website. The Immaculate Conception Catholic Church in Old Town made the statements in its weekly leaflet to churchgoers, a copy of which remains on the church’s website. The letter railed against issues like abortion and constraints on tax-exempt organizations from certain political activity, likening them to slavery. “Satan has deceived many Christians to convert to worldly values from Christian ones,” the Oct. 30 bulletin reads. “The devil does this through the tactics outlined by Saul Alinsky with the outcome as Hillary Clinton has stated, ‘And deep-seated cultural codes, religious beliefs and structural biases have to be changed,’ to draw us away from God’s teachings.”
