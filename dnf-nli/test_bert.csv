"if they even send a subpoena, let alone announce an investigation, that might leak and it might become public and it would unfairly influence the election when voters have no way to interpret the information, miller said. nick ackerman, a former federal prosecutor in new york and an assistant special watergate prosecutor, said comey had no business writing to congress about supposed new emails that neither he nor anyone in the fbi has ever reviewed. he added: it is not the function of the fbi director to be making public pronouncements about an investigation, never mind about an investigation based on evidence that he acknowledges may not be significant. in comeys note to employees, he seemed to anticipate that his decision would be controversial. in trying to strike that balance, in a brief letter and in the middle of an election season, there is significant risk of being misunderstood, comey wrote. tom hamburger contributed to this report. read more: computer seized in weiner probe prompts fbi to take new steps in clinton email inquiry why comey was able to defy justice bosses on clinton email announcement fbi agents waited weeks to tell comey about emails possibly relevant to clinton probe",0,"as america inches toward open revolt over the runaway criminality and collusion of the democrats and the media , another kind of revolt is taking place inside the fbi. according to multiple sources in the independent media now the only remaining free press in america fbi director james comey was forced into announcing a reopening of the criminal investigation into hillary clintons private email server by livid fbi agents who threatened to go public if comey didnt act. james comey, long since suspected to be a clinton operative who deliberately allowed hillary clinton to get away with a vast number of felony crimes and national security violations, now finds himself with his back against the wall. if he releases the evidence against hillary clinton already possessed by the fbi, he will face the wrath of obama, the clintons, the corrupt loretta lynch (doj) and the entire leftist media. if he once again gives hillary clinton a free pass on her numerous crimes, he then faces a mutiny inside the fbi which promises to bypass his authority and leak the criminal evidence directly to the alternative media. fbi agents under comey are desperately trying to save their agency from going down",Found evidence to refute key claims.
nan,2,"if hillary clinton hangs on to win the presidency, liberal democrats have vowed to block her appointment of wall street-friendly officials to key cabinet and sub-cabinet jobs. but there has been little organized resistance to her choosing hawkish foreign policy advisers. indeed, washingtons foreign policy establishment has purged almost anyone who isnt part of the neoconservative/liberal-interventionist group think. thats why pretty much everyone who matters agrees about the need to push around russia, china, syria, iran, etc. reflecting that attitude, sundays lead editorial in the neocon washington post hailed the broad consensus within the establishment for more warlike actions once president obama is gone, taking with him what the post calls obamas self-defeating passivity. the post praised a new report from the liberal center for american progress which calls for bombing the syrian military and getting tough to counter irans negative influence in line with what all the neocons as well as israel and saudi arabia want the next president to do. the absence of any significant counter to this neocon/liberal-hawk group think represents one of the greatest dangers to the future of the human species, since this new hubris comes with a cavalier assumption that nuclear-armed russia and china",Opinion

nan,2,"washington d.c. usa during trumps rise to power as the next president of the united states, he said what the fascist alt-right wanted to hear, then once in power, he disavowed them. trump quite cleverly used the alt-right chump votes to gain power, but now that he is on the cusp of becoming president, trump is dumping his voters for a more diplomatic stance in rhetoric. so, why did you do it? quite simply, the alt-right, is a white supremacist fascist movement , and even though trump may still hold fascistic viewpoints, his advisers have probably told him that he needs to tone down his nasty words a little. chumps the alt-right vote was a surefire winner for trump, purely because the followers would be guaranteed to vote for trump, they are fanatical in their cause, and were fooled very easily into voting for trump. as much as trump courted the ku klux klan, and other white supremacist christian groups during his campaign he knew one thing that hillary did not, and that is these are the silent ostracised groups within america who are guaranteed to vote for something other than an all inclusive democrat. there are many now within",Opinion
