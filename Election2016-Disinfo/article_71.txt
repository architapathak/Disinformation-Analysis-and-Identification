Last Majority White Election, Minorities to Give Democrats White House Through 2060 Paul Bedard, Washington Examiner, November 6, 2016 
This may be the last year that a Republican will be elected president, as the growth of liberal-leaning minorities all but guarantees that Democrats will hold the majority at least for the next four decades. 
Thatâ€™s according to an unusual survey on the impact of minorities, mostly Latin American, done for WalletHub and provided to Secrets . 
The study used two models based on population projections and matched to the overwhelming 65 percent minority turnout for President Obama in 2012 and the underwhelming 50 percent response for George W. Bush in 2004. 
The bottom line: In no presidential election from 2020-60 do the Republicans win. {snip}
