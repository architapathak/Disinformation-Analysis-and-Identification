IT’S ABOUT TIME: Maryland School Official Declares End To Student Trump Protests With No Consequences shares Facebook 
Students at a Maryland high school staged a walkout to protest the election of Trump on Monday. They ended up blocking a highway in the process, which is incredibly dangerous. 
One school official has now said enough is enough. Students who try to protest during school time will suffer consequences. Better late than never, right?

Party’s over, kids: MD school official declares end to consequence-free Trump protests 
A Maryland school official is finally promising disciplinary action for students who protest during school hours after student-led anti-Trump protests turned violent Wednesday morning in Rockville, Md. 
Montgomery County Public Schools Superintendent Jack Smith is “asking and expecting all students to remain in school and participate in the daily educational program as intended,” WTOP in Washington, D.C., reports. Students that refuse to attend class “may be subjected to the regular disciplinary actions that align with whatever infraction is involved.” 
Earlier this week, hundreds of students from Richard Montgomery High School carried signs reading “Love Trumps Hate” and made their way to the local courthouse chanting in protest of Donald Trump’s election. During the protest, a 15-year-old boy wearing a “Make America Great Again” hat was attacked by four students, unprovoked. (Just the latest incident nationwide.) 
Hopefully, other schools will follow suit. 
When did this become acceptable for schoolchildren in the first place?
