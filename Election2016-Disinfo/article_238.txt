BREAKING: Hillary’s ‘LOCKER ROOM’ Moment…Hidden Cam Catches EXPLOSIVE Video! [WATCH] Oct 28, 2016 Previous post 
Project Veritas is releasing one video each day until the election, but their latest video is damning enough to take out Hillary—or at least lose millions of independents in the process. 
Her own campaign, in two separate events shown in the video below, show her complete hypocrisy, dirty dealings and illegal actions to suppress Republican voters. 
But what’s even worse is that for as much as Hillary attacked Trump’s comments released on video from a decade ago , getting her media attack dogs to go after him full force, her own people do exactly the same thing. 
And Project Veritas has brought us the proof. From Political Insider: 
It’s official! Hillary Clinton and her campaign just had their own “locker room moment.” Watch (below) as this hidden camera video from Project Veritas shows Hillary Clinton campaign field organizer Wylie Mao, laughing and bragging about being able to grab a “co-worker’s” ass and not get fired. 
The video was filmed of Mao at a bar in West Palm Beach, and he explained just how acceptable harassment is on Hillary Clinton’s campaign.
