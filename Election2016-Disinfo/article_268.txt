In the final 11 days leading up to the monumental 2016 presidential election, reports have filtered in that thousands of immigrants are headed for the U.S.-Mexico border to illegally enter the United States. Their motivation is crystal clear, according to CBS News York , which explains the sudden influx: 
“The smugglers are telling [the masses of illegal] if Hillary [Clinton] gets elected, that there’ll be some sort of amnesty, that they need to get here by a certain date,” [Border Patrol Agent Chris] Cabrera said. “They’re also being told that if [Donald] Trump gets elected, there’s going to be some magical wall that pops up overnight and once that wall gets up, nobody will ever get in again.” 
Cabrera added that they’ve encountered up to 1,000 immigrants along [the Texas city of] McAllen’s stretch of the border some days. 
It’s not just Donald Trump’s imagination that Democrats are manipulating the immigration process to register as many Hillary Clinton voters as possible. Bloomberg notes independently that a number of American cities are opening allowing illegals to vote. In some cases, an ad hoc workaround is being impemented to give the process an air of respectability.
