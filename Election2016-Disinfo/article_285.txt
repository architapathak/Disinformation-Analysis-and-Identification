According to Daily Star’s report , experts have warned about the conflict that could ensue should the tensions between Russia and the U.S. continue to rise. 
In another report from the Voice of America , Russia’s Defense Ministry officials clarified on Tuesday that the new strikes against Islamic State terror group will be targeting the outskirts of the northern city of Aleppo and would ensue in the next few hours. However, an unidentified source told VOA that the possible strikes were in support of the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. 
“The comments from the Russian Ministry of Defense suggest they are more interested in the world seeing Russia’s naval capabilities in action than the world seeing Russia live up to its word,” the official said. “An escalation would make it harder to resolve the brutal civil war in Syria and raise more doubts about Russia’s commitment.”
