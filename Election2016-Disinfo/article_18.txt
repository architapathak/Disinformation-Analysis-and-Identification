An email released in the recent Wikileaks dump laid out Democrat presidential nominee Hillary Clinton’s real plan for the future — and it didn’t include justice, equality or fairness. Instead, Clinton’s plan for the future revolved around maintaining political power while working to create an “unaware” and “compliant” citizenry. The email came from Bill Ivey, who was appointed Chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts during President Bill Clinton’s second term. It was sent to Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman John Podesta on March 13, 2016. In the email, Ivey considered how Clinton could fight against Trump’s appeal and suggested that simply falling back on previous policies wouldn’t work. “And as I’ve mentioned, we’ve all been quite content to demean government, drop civics and in general conspire to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry,” he said. Ivey admitted how the left has made secret plans to make the public oblivious to their devious plans, but he realized the public isn’t easy to manipulate, which is problematic for Democrats. Unawareness among voters, he insinuated, was a positive for Clinton and the campaign she is running.
