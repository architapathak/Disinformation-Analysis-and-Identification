3,new un chemical weapons report on syria blames assadnew un report contradicts the last un report after having some time to regroup western backed propaganda against the assad government of syria regarding the alleged and erroneous claims of the use of chemical weapons against rebels death squads and civilians has apparently resumed as reuters reports united nations human rights investigators said on tuesday they had reasonable grounds to believe that limited amounts of chemical weapons had been used by government forces in syria reuters also states that in their latest report based on interviews with victims medical staff and other witnesses they said they had received allegations that both syrian government forces and rebels had used the banned weapons but that at least four instances related to their use by state forces paulo pinheiro chair of the un commission of inquiry told a news conference in geneva switzerland there are reasonable grounds to believe that limited quantities of toxic chemicals weapons were used it has not been possible on the evidence available to determine the precise chemical agents used their delivery systems or the perpetrator pinheiro stated that the information he was reporting came from interviews conducted with victims refugees who fled some areas and medical staff the interview process as reuters reports involved teams composed of more than   investigators conducted   interviews from january   to may   among refugees in neighboring countries and by skype with people still in syria the un commission of inquiry largely contradicts earlier reports by its own un investigators into the nature of chemical weapons use in syria interestingly enough while media outlets and western governments cling to whatever brief positive public relations stories surrounding the rebels that may exist those opportunities are few and far between in addition it must be pointed out the inaccurate and intentionally skewed manner in which western media outlets human rights campaigners and western governments gather information that is later parroted back to the public through those same media outlets for instance the reliance on interviews conducted with activists human rights organizations victims medical personnel and obviously rebel forces generally translates to mean one thing interviews and reports with and from the very agents and organizations that are intent on destabilizing and overthrowing the assad government to begin with organizations like the syrian observatory for human rights operated out of the uk by an admitted member of the syrian death squad cult rami abdul rahman are a clear example of the types of human rights organizations consulted when investigators attempt to gather information on the situation on the ground in syria as tony cartalucci of land destroyer writes it is also widely known that any mainstream western media which uses the term activists say to preface any transmission of information can easily be understood as having come straight from the death squads themselves likewise with many of the selected victims and refugees a majority of which bring their own political agendas with them which conveniently tends to match up exactly with the agenda of the western powers seeking to destroy syria yet while the report accuses the assad government of using chemical weapons on the basis of scant dubious and even outright erroneous evidence it also attempts to defend the syrian death squads it reads it is possible that anti government armed groups may access and use chemical weapons    though there is no compelling evidence that these groups possess such weapons or their requisite delivery systems this claim is fundamentally untrue first as mentioned above it directly contradicts the reports by other un investigators such as carla del ponte second in december   a video was obtained by the syria tribune and subsequently released in their report and posted on youtube which allegedly shows the nato backed death squads testing chemical weapons on lab rabbits as the syria tribune describes the video the syria tribune also comments that judging from the rabbits reaction the gas must be a nerve agent the number of containers if not a bluff indicates ability to produce a considerable amount of this gas deployment could be by means of a smoke generator placed in the target area an explosion possibly a suicide one of a chemmed car or simply by using a humidifier in march   yet another youtube video was released which contained a clip of a second test of chemical weapons on captive rabbits by the death squads this is quite an ironic presentation since the assad government has repeatedly vowed never to use chemical weapons inside syria while the death squads have repeatedly threatened to do just that indeed in direct contrast to the tone and statements of the death squads the syrian foreign ministry spokesman jihad makdissi issued a statement several months ago saying no chemical or biological weapons will ever be used and i repeat will never be used during the crisis in syria no matter what the developments inside syria regardless the video mentioned above also contains an alleged audio recording of a phone conversationbetween two free syrian army fighters discussing the details of a plan to carry out a chemical weapons attack capable of impacting an area the size of one kilometer as paul joseph watson writes the video also contains a clip of the death squads openly announcing their plans to engage in chemical weapons attacks all the while surrounded by bottles of nitric acid and other substances back in december   after the death squads managed to capture a chlorine factory inside syria the syrian government actually issued a warning that the death squads might attempt to use chemical weapons of this nature in their battle to overthrow and oppress the government and people of syria respectively the syrian foreign ministry stated terrorist groups may resort to using chemical weapons against the syrian people after having gained control of a toxic chlorine factory thus with the subsequent chemical weapon attack which has caused both a frothing and bumbling public relations response from the anglo americans it is interesting to note that chlorine was fingered as being one of the major ingredients as alex thomson of the telegraph reported reports by the syrian government coincide with the accounts given by the victims of the chemical weapons attack which one can view in the video clip contained in the youtube video mentioned above see here it is also important to note that many of the victims allegedly name the free syrian army and the rebels as the perpetrators as they are being interviewed while waiting for medical treatment the free syrian army hit us with a rocket one woman said we smelled an odor and everyone fell to the ground people died where they fell    the kids    a young girl was also interviewed who said my lungs closed and i couldnt breathe or speak god curse them everyone died on the ground my mom and dad died i dont know where is my brother god curse them may they fsa all die this is the freedom they bring us they fsa want to kill everyone i hope there remains not a single one of them fsa alive for more detailed information regarding the use of chemical weapons by syrian death squads i suggest reading my march     article false flag attacks in syria pin atrocities on assad and justify red line engagement lastly the un report laughably attempts to absolve the death squads of war crimes while shifting the burden of cruelty and savage conduct to that of the assad government while asserting that syrian government forces have been responsible for committing torture rape forcible displacement and enforced disappearance no credible and often even no incredible evidence is ever provided to bolster the claims while admitting that the death squads have carried out sentencing and execution without due process as well as committing torture taking hostages and pillaging the report hilariously states that crimes committed by the death squads did not however reach the intensity and scale of those committed by government forces and affiliated militias perhaps the united nations commission was simply unaware of videos showing the death squads machine gunning captives beheading prisoners see here and here and forcing young children to behead them i myself have written an article dealing with reports regarding the death squads hanging of a young child after murdering his family in front of him one can also view the videos of the death squad members beating and humiliating the famous elderly yellow man in aleppo indeed the videos of the torture of prisoners in the hands of the death squads are legion one need only type the relevant keywords into a youtube search engine to be greeted with generous results read other articles by

with an apology for his stance on marijuana i mistakenly believed the drug enforcement agency listed marijuana as a schedule   substance because of sound scientific proof he wrote schedule   drugs are considered extremely dangerous with no medical value but like medical marijuana advocates have been saying for years that just aint so weed featured the story of six year old charlotte figi who has a severe type of epilepsy known as dravet syndrome she suffered   seizures a week modern medicine was unable to help the family finally pursued medical marijuana the kind thats high in cbd the medicinal cannabinoid and low in thc the psychoactive one shes now down to seven seizures a week and the results were immediate some of the documentary still fell short though weed showed an increasing rate of

from the dea advising they were about to seize her houseboat she later removed the video instead posting a comment confirming the seizure these raids constitute one of president obamas single biggest days of paramilitary action in the federal crackdown on medical cannabis patients and providers said medical marijuana activist mike liszewski of marijuana patient advocacy group americans for safe

4,special to the washington post the tentative deal announced wednesday whereby tehran will transfer about three quarters of its nuclear fuel out of the country for enrichment in russia came after nearly three days of talks between senior us and iranian officials even before those discussions the face to face meeting this month between senior us and iranian officials in geneva was much ballyhooed    but not unprecedented since   officials of the two countries have been quietly meeting in the hague to resolve billions of dollars in claims arising from the iranian revolution and the resulting rupture of diplomatic relations between the two countries the meetings are held under the auspices of the iran us claims tribunal which was established by the agreement that resolved the   hostage crisis while it has done important work the tribunal has largely outlived its utility for both sides    and the obama administration could face a significant international legal challenge if the tribunal orders the united states to make large monetary payments to the iranian government the tribunal behaves much like a court iran and the united states submit brief and argue cases before nine judges three appointed by each country and three third country judges mutually agreed upon or appointed by a neutral authority its hearings held in a converted hotel on a residential street have allowed us and iranian legal advisers and their teams to speak directly on a range of issues when it was set up under the algiers accords the tribunal was expected to resolve all outstanding claims in a few years it has labored for nearly three decades conducting more than   hearings and issuing more than    orders the tribunal has made   awards resolving claims by nationals of the two countries or by one government against the other including more than    billion in awards to us nationals or the us government and roughly   billion to the iranian government it is still working on some of the most complicated cases disputes relating to contracts for sales and services of military equipment produced by us companies for iran before   matters have long been complicated by the consistently bad behavior of the iranian government for more than a decade iran failed to pay hundreds of millions of dollars into a security account established for judgments in favor of us claimants it has repeatedly filed challenges to the third country judges who have ruled against iranian claims iran even denounced the tribunals appointing authority a former chief justice of the dutch supreme court after he rejected its demand to remove tribunal president krzysztof skubiszewski a former polish foreign minister last year all three iranian judges resigned en masse citing disagreements with the other judges irans strategy appears to be seeking to force out the third country judges so they can be replaced by judges more to tehrans liking or to provoke the us administration into a dramatic overreaction so far neither has happened and the   year old skubiszewski who grew up resisting nazi and communist oppression appears unlikely to bow to bullying in july the tribunal dismissed   to   irans claim for    billion in compensation for military equipment that had been ordered by shah mohammad reza pahlavi but that the us government had refused to allow us companies to deliver after the hostage crisis had the tribunal ordered washington to pay iran even a fraction of what it had sought the administration would have been forced to choose between complying with us obligations under the algiers accords and thus paying millions of dollars or more to a government that has been supporting terrorism and secretly building uranium enrichment facilities or ignoring an international court but the obama administration still faces a threat the tribunal left the door open for iran to relitigate aspects of this dispute and tehran still has claims worth billions of dollars in other cases the administration must decide what approach to take toward the tribunal under international law the administration has a reasonable basis for suspending us participation in the dispute resolution body because of iranian efforts to undermine it but this administration has emphasized its commitment to international law and choosing this option could incur international criticism and further legal challenges the tentative deal announced wednesday is expected to buy time to establish a diplomatic solution to the impasse over irans nuclear ambitions rather than continuing to hope for the best the obama administration should add the future of the tribunal and remaining bilateral claims to the list of issues to be discussed with iran us negotiators might suggest that the tribunal be dissolved with outstanding iranian claims withdrawn in exchange for us payment for enrichment of iranian uranium outside of iran issues concerning diplomatic properties of both governments which have been the subject of claims before the tribunal could also be resolved paving the way for the gradual resumption of diplomatic ties if it does nothing the administration may lose an opportunity to close down a diplomatic vestige and risk future tribunal awards that the united states would be legally required to pay but find it politically impossible to do so the writer a partner in arnold  porter llp and an adjunct senior fellow in international and national security law at the council on foreign relations served as state department legal adviser from april   to january   in that capacity he appeared before the tribunal

4,it must be said that date night    in which a suburban married couple out for an evening in manhattan endure car chases and the unwanted attention of thugs with guns    is superior to most recent movies of its kind the marital action comedy this is not saying much better than the bounty hunter or did you hear about the morgans is not quite the same as good the presence of tina fey and steve carell in the main roles may promise something more since rather than being the usual mismatched nice looking pair of romantic comedy corn muffins they are accomplished professional funny people especially on television and thats part of the problem date night sets these stars afloat in a busy and conventional story hoping that their proven talents or maybe their reputations will keep the picture from sinking it doesnt entirely but treading water for   minutes is no great accomplishment though fey shows occasional flashes of the smart anxious sarcasm that drives liz lemon through the showbiz tumult of   rock and though you cant look at carells face without inferring the antic cluelessness of michael scott in the office both performers are constrained by the drab formula demanded by long form big screen entertainment as claire and phil foster a real estate agent and an accountant with two kids and a house in new jersey fey and carell shoulder the laugh killing burden of ordinary likability which means that they cant be too smart too witty or too weird a flurry of outtakes accompanying the end credits suggests how much livelier this movie might have been if they had been allowed to improvise everything or had just written the script themselves without regard for plot twists and character arcs and all the other creaky hollywood machinery that keeps them running frantically from one set piece to the next date night dutifully directed by shawn levy night at the museum among much else from a hectic half baked screenplay by josh klausner the last and next shrek movies does have moments of pleasant mischief most of these come courtesy of supporting players who either turn carell and fey into straight men or else briefly rouse them to competitive comic life it is not surprising and always a relief to see kristen wiig in a movie like this one and there is nothing shocking about encountering mark wahlberg without a shirt on but claire and phils contrasting reactions to the spectacle of his pectorals do elicit a few laughs and then wahlberg speaks hebrew which can hardly fail to be hilarious even more so is an encounter with james franco and mila kunis as a pair of would be alphabet city outlaws who show up to advance the plot and then for a few blessed moments derail it entirely about that plot who cares the fosters worried that their marriage has gone stale and that theyve turned boring impulsively head into the city arriving at a super chic restaurant without a reservation they hijack another couples table and then are mistaken for that other couple by a pair of bad guys jimmi simpson and common who work for other bad guys all of them scrambling to retrieve a flash drive with some sensitive information on it this means that guns will be pointed windshields will shatter and a lot of other noise will distract the audience from the uneven dialogue and scattershot marital foolery would you permit a brief discourse on the state of verbal humor in modern screen comedy well never mind then but let me just say that date night like so many other films of its type too often relies on words catchphrases and inflections that signify a generally accepted notion of funniness rather than being you know actually funny for example the word vagina has no intrinsically humorous properties but its uttered here as if believing that it did were sufficient to make it so same thing with the sarcastic rhetorical question    seriously really    that has become an almost universal lazy substitute for the traditional double take and then there is the habit of trying to make a line retroactively uproarious by admitting that it really wasnt funny to begin with as in i have no idea what i just said ha ha but i know just what im trying to say date night not untypically tries to go both meta  and sub  to be straightforwardly schticky archly self conscious and also in the end sweet and sincere this should not be an impossible feat and carell and fey might have been able to pull it off    if they had only been permitted to try production notes date night produced and directed by shawn levy written by josh klausner director of photography dean semler music by christophe beck production designer david gropman costumes by marlene stewart released by  th century fox running time   hour   minutes with steve carell phil foster tina fey claire foster mark wahlberg holbrooke grant taraji p henson detective arroyo kristen wiig haley sullivan james franco taste mila kunis whippit jimmi simpson armstrong and common collins date night is rated pg   sexual references naughty words and gunshots    most of them perfectly innocuous

3,safe natural alternatives to the flu shotwill you line up for this years lethal injection selfnews post want   off your bill at the grocery store stop by our pharmacy and let us jab a needle full of toxins into your arm want to avoid killing off your newborn your elderly neighbor and some random unvaccinated cancer patient do your part by getting stabbed want to circumvent potential death by influenza just get your flu shot at any of our convenient walk in locations want to keep your job get your mandatory flu shot or your fired but dont worry its free its that time of year again the propaganda machine is in high gear churning out the fear in order to get everyone lined up for their annual flu shots widely trusted websites like thecdc flugov and themayo clinicare all trumpeting the necessity of this years vaccination and proclaiming it to be the best way to stay healthy this year the focus is on pregnant women and people who are employed at long term health care facilities dont be surprised to see another rash of get your flu shot or lose your job ultimatums for nursing home workers last year workplaces schools and other activities across the us and canada instituted policies that forced all participants to receive a flu shot long term hospital employees were fired for refusing to have the toxin injected into themselves children were banned from pre schools and daycares in   states nursing students were told to have the shot or lose their placements thus disqualifying them for their degrees the media and government launched a full out propaganda assault to force those who didnt want it to have the flu shot anyway at risk of their livelihoods and educations what the propagandists and flu shot proponents fail to mention are the horror stories like the fact that   senior citizens in that touted high risk must get a shot group just died from the same flu shots that are given at local pharmacies with no accountability no prescription necessary and no check up from the doctor but you do get a handy   off shopping pass when you get your flu shot flu shots mean big money to the pharmacies to the doctors and to the drug companies the frenzy with which the flu shot is promoted is directly proportionate to the profit margin but those lining their pockets fail to mention that you could be paying them to give you and your family a lethal injection why i wont get a flu shot my first thought when the government absolutely insists that i do something is heck no call me a conspiracy theorist if you want to im cool with that but the insistence of the powers that be that my family and i be injected with foreign substances that have not been proven to be effective and that have mild to severe side effects makes me plain suspicious my family and i will not be getting a flu shot this year or any other year for   reasons check out last years article   reasons why ill never get a flu shot for more details on each of these reasons just like with any other sales pitch the more insistent the salesman and the less information they want to give you about the product the faster you should run the other direction butisnt the shot the best way to prevent catching the flu you will hear in about    variations that the best way to prevent catching the flu is to receive your annual flu shot this is actually untrue the absolute number one way to avoid catching the flu is through the exercise of good personal hygiene   use a paper towel to open bathroom doors and turn on taps   although im normally not a big fan of hand sanitizer use it during the height of flu season if you have to touch things that everyone else has been touching like the handle of the shopping cart door knobs and debit machines   use antibacterial wipes or at least baby wipes to wash your hands and wipe the steering wheel when you get back into your vehicle   avoid touching your face this welcomes germs that are on your hands into your body   during the height of flu season consider taking a quick shower and changing clothes when you return home particularly if you have been in a germ ridden place like a doctors office or pharmacy   make sure the kids change clothes and thoroughly wash their hands when they return home from school   i shouldnt really have to say this butwash your hands after using the bathroom and before preparing or eating food if your local area is being hit hard by the flu practice avoidance to keep your family healthy   stay home as much as possible obviously if you have work and school outside the home this become more difficult but avoid malls movie theaters and sporting events for the duration of the epidemic   stay away from sick people if you can   avoid eating at restaurants you dont know the health or hygiene habits of the kitchen staff if someone in your family is sick try to minimize the spread of the illness   if you or a family member are sick stay home from work or school to prevent passing it on to others   if a family member is sick keep them isolated away from the rest of the family   use antibacterial wipes to clean surfaces that the sick person touches doorknobs tv remotes keyboards toilet handles and phones   immediate place dishes and flatware used by the sick person into hot soapy dishwater with a drop of bleach in it   teach children to cough into the crook of their arm instead of covering their mouth with their hands   have the sick person wash their hands frequently with soap and water to help prevent spreading germs through physical contact if soap and water is unavailable have them use hand sanitizer some other ways to stay healthy are to use natural strategies to maximize your immune system   drink lots of water to keep your system hydrated and efficient   take a high quality organic multi vitamin   take at least   ius of vitamin d  daily research has shown a link between a vitamin d deficit and susceptibility to the flu   eat lots of fruits and vegetables preferably organic and pesticide free   get     hours of sleep per day a tired body has a weaker immunity against viruses   dont smoke this weakens your resistance against respiratory illnesses and worsens the effect on your body if you do become ill   avoid or limit alcoholic beverages   avoid or limit processed foods should you head to the pharmacy if you get the flu if despite all of your precautions you do get sick you dont have to resort to over the counter remedies and prescription antivirals these can have horrendous side effects and are rarely effective check outthis article to learn more about the treatments from the pharmacy and discover some effective remedies that are as close as your kitchen as well consider investing in natures version of tamiflu elderberry extract scientists have isolated the active compound in the elderberry it is called antivirin and is found in proteins of the black elderberry the compound prevents the flu virus from invading the membranes of healthy cells if you are sick increase your levels of vitamin d  to medicinal level doses it has been proven to reduce the time and severity of flu symptoms learn more about this treatment option from the vitamin d council the information on vitamin d is great but sadly the article contains flu shot and tamiflu propaganda so take the beneficial information and mentally set aside the rest the worst case scenario is that you do indeed contract the flu despite the hullabaloo you are probably not going to die be hospitalized or suffer horrific permanent damage from a bout of the flu people get sick but death from the seasonal flu is rare this manufactured panic over flu prevention is agenda based big pharma wants money and big government wants control i dont believe that all health care professionals and flu shot advocates have ill intent i think that many of them have just sipped the mainstream media kool aid the tale spinners of big pharma have slipped in just enough truth to make their theories believable most people are deep down decent and have difficulty believing that such a perverse moneypower agenda could exist ill take the risk of illness that my healthy immune system can fight off over the risk of being forcibly inoculated with whatever toxins the creators of these vaccines choose to include ill use my little arsenal of home remedies and come through it without the risk of long term side effects that have yet to be discovered or at least have yet to be made public daisy luther is a freelance writer and editor her websitethe organic prepper wherethis article first appeared

3,cancer cancer everywhere  but not in the presidential suiteby janet phelan however there are indications that the cure for cancer may have already been found and that those who have it are keeping it close to their chests in order to support this contention which may be seen as alarming and extreme one must look at the rates of cancer among the general population and compare these to the rates of cancer deaths among world leaders and the latter is almost non existent in the us cancer is the second leading cause of death exceeded only by heart disease according to recently breaking news australia now lists cancer as its leading cause of death in the rest of the developed world cancer is near the top of the list a recent list published by the world cancer research fund international shows that denmark leads the pack in terms of cancer rates indeed the list of the fifty countries with the highest cancer rates might lead one to believe that cancer is a disease of prosperity conspicuously absent from the list are countries in the third worldin particular africa cancer will fell approximately of all those living in the developed world however this particular manifestation of the grim reaper gives world leaders a wide berth since   when the exiled shah of iran succumbed to lymphatic cancer in egypt the deaths by cancer of those leading their nations can be counted on the fingers of one hand and what is most telling about those on this short list is where they stood on the political spectrum hugo chavez the colorful and controversial president of venezuela between     was a socialist and prominent adversary of us foreign policy and neo liberalism before succumbing to cancer in   chavez made a much publicized radio announcement in which he speculated that the us government gave him cancer chavez has been quoted as saying would it be so strange that theyve invented the technology to spread cancer and we wont know about it for   years he is also quoted as saying fidel castro always told me chvez take care these people have developed technology you are very careless take care what you eat what they give you to eat a little needle and they inject you with i dont know what since his death venezuela has crumbled into economic chaos vaclav havel who was the last president of czechoslovakia and the first president of the czech republic is somewhat of a more ambiguous character while he is seen as being a pivotal player in breaking up the soviet bloc and therefore bringing what is popularly termed democracy to a formerly communist country he may have also been serving us and cia interests either unintentionally or otherwise in his period of political dissidence prior to ascending to power havel was imprisoned a number of times the longest incarceration being four years as president havel was instrumental in dismantling the warsaw pact and expanding nato into eastern european countries havel died of lung cancer in   at the age of   jack layton the head of canadas new democratic party succumbed to an unspecified newly diagnosed cancer in   so when the ndp swept the national parliamentary elections in   winning   seats the ndp became canadas official opposition laytons tenancy as head of the opposition was short lived however layton succumbed to cancer less than four months later passing on in august of   he had been committed to ousting the conservative harper government following laytons death the ndp tumbled from its position and currently occupies third place in canadas parliament as prime minister of the tiny island of barbados david thompson could only marginally have been considered a world leader the population of barbados is less than    mostly black barbados also known as little england is an independent state with the british monarch as hereditary head of state thompson was in office from   until october of   when he passed away from pancreatic cancer one of the most deadly forms of the big c statistically since cancer is listed as cause of death in roughly of all deaths one might logically expect that one quarter of the us presidents and one quarter of the us vice presidents to pick one example would have cancer listed as cause of death with   presidents and   vice presidents one might think that somewhere in the realm of   or so might have succumbed to cancer however there are none zero zilch a search for cancer as a cause of death for german french or british leaders in the past forty years produces only one name that of former french president francois mitterrand who succumbed to prostate cancer in   at the age of   mitterrand was the first french president who was a socialist and he led the nation for fourteen years as its longest serving president since the   throat cancer death of edward viiiwho abdicated the throne in  no members of british royalty have died of cancer in october of this year the world cancer leaders summit will be convening in paris france the announcement for this summit states that the world cancer leaders summit brings together global decision makers who can shape the way our generation addresses the task of eliminating cancer as a life threatening disease for future generations their announcement also states the summit plays a pivotal role in this portfolio of global events by ensuring that the   targets detailed in the world cancer declaration are appropriately recognised and addressed at the highest political levels however those at the highest political levels are often seen as escaping repercussions for criminal behavior and worse the idea of the teflon coated political elite is an idea that has now gained generalalbeit grimacceptance given the probability that the cure may already exist in light of the unusual lack of incidence of fatal cancers afflicting the powerful one might want to ask the summit if the world leaders might be willing to share please janet phelan is an investigative journalist whose articles have appeared in

cannot even survive in the body of a person that maintains a ph in the high neutralalkalinity range so it is easily preventable it is curable by various natural means including high doses of curcumin high doses of laetrile known as vitamin b   which has been outlawed by the fda since   or high doses of cbd oil which the fda is desperately trying to regulate cancerlike open air prisons two party political systems and the tv show the goldbergsis unnecessary unlikely this theory has no research support we have know since the  s that cancer is a resperation problem and develops in an oxygen starved environment and thrives on acidic conditions you are making medical claims for which there is no evidence and dangerously offer false hope tho you have no background in oncology research wild animals get cancerhow is that correlated with it is unnecessary wild exaggerations and claims are dangerous dont believe everything you read and dont promote ideas that you believe but can provide no real research to support your humor is appreciated but it masks a cruel hoax in offering false hope to people like me my  th year into fighting cancer i will start vit b  and mitoq since all my other nothing is more cruel than false hope we shall let the reader compare my comment to yours i will add dr royal raymond fife and dr james jeffrey bradstreet your assignment is to read up on these two fine gentlemen one last thing my comment is not funny you are giving me assignments i already have one an appointment with an oncologist involved in immunotherapy but i am always happy to learn so i am looking up the doctors i do not take him seriously and his research was not peer reviewed relegating it to the ash heap of unproven theories royal rife wiki gives   primary sources for this summary also you forgot that fraud wakefield whose own co researches have claimed he falsified data i dont buy it and i have been into alternative medicine for   years the quacks the crackpots and their followers do not interest me i will try any natural supplement which have peer reviewed research and i take no prescription drugs if all else fails i will try immunotherapy from my standford oncologist i have tried dozens of sure cures which failed i have not given up but i have no time to waste with pseudo science your faux impassioned plea for sympathy has fallen on deaf ears we are familiar with such alinsky tactics we do notice that we are making you work for your paycheck though there is no plea for sympathy but for critical thinking you say we so who is paying you to rub out anyone with dissenting ideas to the herd thinking you assume of other activistpost readers alinksy tactics included false pleas for sympathy are real pleas ok this is not work and you still me   bucks for my last article i do it out of love of the truth about a subject i have a vital interest in as i try to cure my cancer that is not a plea but the foundation of my passion your libel is funnyand i note you totally ignore the evidence i present you said get back after checking out the doctors and i did and then you ignored it your cold and lying words would be insulting if they were not patently absurd i forgive you for you know not what you do well youve got an appointment with an oncologist and i have to pick my nose why dont you have the last word ohand that forgiveness the only one who can forgive me is myself but thanks anyway foregiveness is given it lives in my heart i forgive you and hope you will get over your nastyness especially to people suffering from cancer my last word is i foregive you for your nastinessyou are probably a good person who just likes to troll and vent on the internet i wish you well manthat was some suckya last words ok take   aw cmon man you call that a last word i can see we need a huddle here ok now the problem we have here is that you sound a little jee eh why normally i would say that is not a bad thing but you have a jerry sanduskybarack obama type of jee eh why vibe goin on and that is just weak you want to be cue you ee ee are strong my man like val kilmer in kiss kiss bang bang or buck henry in the man who fell to earth even better like that record producer in clint eastwoods jersey boys now that eff eh jee jee oh tee is lip bitingly hot and but more importantly he projects strength ok ok then solast word take   readers who accept non peer reviewed claims over peer reviewed are unqualified to make a rational comparison like most gullible people who fall for quackery you ignore the evidence and facts i presented because they dont fit your beliefs your comment is not funny it is dangeous as it offers false hope and dismisses serious criticism of amateur research not subject to peer review i find you command to look into a couple of quacks kind of funny however lol very good article and in particular those poor individuals that get cancer and those who dont you never see the zios get cancer but if you oppose them like chavez aaron russo doug christie anthony lawson these individual seem to get insidious cancers yet the chosenites seem immune kissinger albright rockerfeller and all the old zios that run well into their  s hw b bush they can give it but they rarely get it add george pratts schulz and a host of other putrid zios probably have access to dr stanislaw burzynskis antineoplastons which he discovered way back in the  s by now the treatment could have been perfected instead burzynski is being hounded again with government threats and negative media coverage theres also dr nicolas gonzalez on record having saved patients from advanced stage pancreatic cancer using food supplements and detoxing he was on to the nagalase link to cancer before he died of a heart attack  despite being a very healthy man with no history of heart disease even   years after burzynski started peddling his antineoplastons they have never shown any significant anticancer activity in any trial conducted by him or anyone else for that matter the dr gonzalez protocol was tested in pancreatic cancer pubmed pmc  not only was the median half survival of patients in the gonzalez therapy group worse than it was for the chemo group it was three times worse at one year   of the chemotherapy patients were alive and only   of the gonzalez protocol patients were in addition to this the gonzalez therapy patients did than the average pancreatic cancer patient as determined by the survival curve derived from data from the seer database also the patients in the gonzalez therapy group had a much poorer quality of life on top of this george vi died of lung cancer then there was the queens sister margaret who had part of her lung removed because of a lung cancer scare prince michael of kent had prostate cancer and even the queen mother had colon and breast cancer too sharing please is not going to work you have to hold their feet to the fire definitely they have some knowledge of resistance or cure the elites dont eat gmo agree and no process foods my grandfather loved to   had he own garden walked a couple of miles everyday did not smoke but did have snuff ug nor do i and i have cancer my guess is that many political leaders being clueless on diet eat meat   of which contains gmo   factory farmed    pasture fed which includes up to   gmo alfalfa and only   organic being non gmo unless leaders eat like the organic obamas they are ingesting gmo people who reject science global warming etc are unlikely to be sophisticated about the harm of gmo food production   glyphosate carcinogenic stop making claims you cant back up dale yours is a passionate response to be sure there are natural ways to fight cancer i know because i rejected the usual cures of chemo and radiation for a more organic approach my cancer began to disappear in four months and was completely gone six months out the tumor was located between my clavicle bone and shoulder it reached the size of a golf ball before i started my natural regimen this even worked for my dog casey who had an extremely aggressive form of cancer called hemangiosarcoma the size of a cantaloupe for which there are few solutions he was given two months to live tops and i had him still alive happy and functional for almost a year his tumor shrank down to the size small than two golf balls right next to each other until his hip displacia boiled everything down to a quality of life issue i miss him the regimen i used was based on process now know as the anti angiogenic diet the basic foods or supplements i used were raw almonds lots of onions and garlic on my food corral calcium turmeric curcumin vitamin e and vitamin d strawberries blueberries and alpha lipoic acid and acetyl l carnitine why does it work long story but the simplest answer is that cancer cells grow much faster than normal cells and for this reason have to acquire a blood supply that grows with the tumor otherwise the tumor eventually outstrips its food supply and will stall out and die the trick is to do all you need to stop the growth of that blood supply it is rooted in the production of an enzyme by tumors called cox   cyclo oxygenase   which stimulates the growth of new capillaries and blood vessels angio genesis that seek out the source of the cox   enzyme namely the tumor some of the latest anti angiogenic nsaids non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs like avastin are what youd call cox   re uptake inhibitors they even have a version for pets like metacam but they are very toxic and can cause lots of digestive problems including ulcers and bleeding there are components in these foods and vitamins listed above that have powerful natural cox   re uptake inhibitor qualities without the toxic side effects like the flavenoids in onions and garlic as one example there are scientific studies that show conclusively the certain populations italians for example have significantly lower levels of certain cancers that have been linked to their diets which are high in onions garlic and tomatoes the best explanation ive seen was the ted video lecture by dr william li at this link httpswwwtedcomtalkswilliamlilanguageen thank you for the thoughtful response i have been reading real cancer research and it is very complicated good for you that it worked but it hasnt for me my experience is that people with zero background in medicine let alone oncology research continue to tell me of a cure in all cases i have tried that cure and it failed i will continue my alkaline vegan diet with supplements mushrooms etc etc and alkaline water and i will be adding mitoq and mitotemp which research shows to be very effective in actually getting to the mitochondria and killing cancer cells its expensive but then what good is my money if i did i also have also order vitamin b   so i can up my dose of apricot kernal extract and i will take aspirin with it as the combination has had striking success in targeting and killing cancer cells i am also seeing a regular oncologist who specializes in immunotherapy in case none of this natural treatment works ten years ago i took one year with alternative treatments no results now i have tried cannabis curcumin vit c and e d  etc etc etc no results i will keep trying but when people tell me they have the cure i usually find that the cure did not work for me it worked for you and your dogthats great but the stuff you mentioned has not worked so i keep trying what works for one person obviously does not work for all i will try anything which does no harm tho i have learned to dismiss claims that someone has the cure if someone really had the cure there would be no cancer nsaids are very effective in the research and very cheapand yet many who regularly take aspirin get cancer i am going to try the combination researchers found successful in many cases mitoq with mitotempo with aspirin i hope for the best but prepare for the worst dinner was tomato onion garlic microgreens watercress almonds and other nuts and seeds with honeyginger dressing and a good dose of lemon which makes alkaline i popped a mouthful of vit c d  b complex and e as well as taurine selenium curcumin garlic pills flax oil hemp oil and a few others taking it down with my alkalinized water i filter with brita then put that water in a my zero water device which alkalines and mineralizes i do not use added sugar and not even fruit juice just smoothies with fiberetc i eat broccoli every day of my life i have been on an anti cancer diet for   years tho in my  s and  s i ate a lot of candy i live in a very clean area in the redwood forests of the santa cruz mountains with the largest biomass and oxygen producer in the world the   ft trees on my property tho i earlier have lived in more polluted environments such as the slums of ny city i thank you for your response i will keep experimentingand if all else fails i will seek the immunotherapy treatment which relies on the bodies own immune system to fight cancer and has been very successful so far cancer is still very much a mystery as the research makes clear no disease has as many untrained experts on cancer nor so few trained professionals that will say we have the cure there may be dozens of cures that work for some but not others studies of twins has shown a genetic component to cancer or a vulnerability linked to dna so my dna may be vulnerable and yours not thanks again dale there may be another way which perhaps you have tried in the truth about cancer series one connecting factor in all of the various cures was the mind heart spirit or prayerful meditative aspect in ancient traditions medicine or healing is that which works even the word medicine is rooted in the words for remedy  meditate also comes from the same root word sometimes the healing requires a deep inner work which may take time each insight will lead you to the next step ask the creator to guide you to the healing it may be as much spiritual as physical healing that takes place there may be some changes in life that need to be taken besides what you have already endured letting go of things which give rise to sufferingdifficulty stressful situations or people letting go of old past injuries etc i used meditation exclusively as i live in a developing country where the treatments are not very advanced i had no choice but to go very deep into my heartmind and talk to my dna ancestors karma the lord forgiveness everything this lead to finding those things which help support the healing there is now much more info about meditation healing as well as the epi genetics changablility of the dna it is all impermanent and can change one other issue that is extremely important for my own health and does affects our bodies ph is naturally occurring phytic grains nuts seeds and beans andor oxalic acid  many vegetables in natural foods we have been fermenting souring and sprouting foods for  s of years and only recently the practice is regaining the necessary attention the necessary information is obtained through google so i wont get into it here but one other important thing is that tomato and pepper seeds have a natural protective barrier that is toxic and i definitely have to remove these before eating i make my own cayenne pepper minus the seeds and i grow and freeze my own tomatoes minus the seeds yes this is my diet i have been vegetarian for   years vegan the last   all i eat are what you mention and i toss a little hot pepper power i was given in costa rica on every meal i take no prescription drugs if all else fails and i will try anything that does no harm i am scheduled to see an oncologist who specializes in immunotherapy which uses the bodys own immune system and has had great results so far but because of genetic differences proven in studies of twins which is a part of the picture some are more vulnerable than others which may explain why a cure which worked in   months for one person will fail in another i recently during my cannabis extract treatment lost   lbs so i am a much healthier weight and can sleep longer also essential to health thank you for your suggestions on diet which i endorse hey dale i am not sure if i agree that being vegan is the healthiest choice unless your stomach is working optimally and can recycle b  there are other necessary factors for good health that are only obtained from animal foid sources i definitely dont support the animal torture going on but a true fact is that chickens were domesticated  bc i got zero water only to find that while my tap water is about   ph the zero water after all solids are removed is very very acidthe worst water i could drink they dont tell this as many buy it for health reasons turns out the solids they filter out in an acid filter are what makes water alkaline so now i am buying different waters advertised as alkaline a premium added one from the place where i had the best water in my lifedunsmuirca near mt shasta it was natural and said      it measured    just above my tap wateranother tested    so bought the purified with minerals added which claims     still to test and found at a local chain raleys the bargain basement brand still to test i am using only those over   i have read that adding lemon to water will turn it alkaline so i will test that as for the dichloroacetate i tried that buying it online before it was banned from a vet website the study in canada obseved that puppies given this hideous chemicalhad an ungainly gait hmnnnso i took it perhaps overdid it and it brought my psa down but then stalled the side effect was peripheral neuropathy in my fingers and toesmy toes   years later are still afflicted its permanent thursday i see an oncologist who does immunotherapy the dr b sounds sketchy wikipedia has two sources for this the clinics version of personalized medicine bears little resemblance to targeted cancer therapy as the clinic includes chemotherapy drugs and antineoplastons are part of this treatment this link offers a detailed analysis of what is viewed as snake oil which the good doctor of course sells i do not take medical advice from people with a conflict of interest in selling me something httpswwwsciencebasedmedicineorgstanislaw burzynski antineoplastons and the orphan drug sodium phenyl butyrate the author of the critizue dr gorski observesit turns out that a lot of burzynskis patients who have been featured in news stories as successes or potential successes are found to be neither when someone bothers to follow up on them to see how theyre doing now this is very similar to the group of patients featured when dr burzynski first gained fame for his cancer therapy back in   after sally jesse raphaels show featured four miracle patients of burzynskis who according to her had had incurable cancer and failed conventional therapies but were rendered cancer free thanks to dr burzynski unfortunately four years later in   inside edition followed up these four patients and found that two of the four had died and a third had recurred while the fourth had had bladder cancer with a good prognosis in that report the widow of one of raphaels guests reported that her husband and five others had sought treatment from burzynski and that all had died yikes heres another report the clinic clearly states that antineoplastons are nontoxic that is untrue the most obvious issue that has arisen is hypernatremiaan overload of sodium in the blood which will cause serious complications seizures and swelling of the brain were also reported this treatment is a form of chemotherapy the body is being overloaded with something that is not normally present there will be side effects it is not nontoxic source the burzynski research institute bri studies and synthesizes antineoplastons in the forty years that antineoplastons have been known there has yet to be definitive evidence that shows this treatment works as described thats a long time wheres the evidence there have been no randomized controlled trials rcts done the gold standard of medical research studies why there have not been rcts is a highly relevant question that dr b has dodged he has not walked the walk or done the work necessary to constitute solid scientific research his preliminary trials for antineoplastons were problematic source over sixty trials called phase ii trials have been registered in the appropriate databases yet only one was stated to be complete and nothing has been published on any of them where are the rest the trials continue unreported httpwwwcsicoporgspecialarticlesshowburzynskiclinicascientificalyearoffail the doctor is not an oncologist or geneticist he appears to be a quack like many snake oil salesmen he has a kind of cult following with supporter claiming the medical profession fears his alternative cancer treatmentswhich include chemotherapy etc i thank you for your concern but in  th year of dealing with cancer i am offeredwith the kindest intentions much that is fraudulent i will investigate real immunotherapycontinue my alkaline low methionine vegan diet and add new supplements like mitoq and vit b  all of which have real research behind them another friendan oncologist from serbiahas told me provenge is very promising meanwhile i have lost   lbs and am an athletic    lbswith my energy coming back after the intense sedation of my unsuccessful cannabis extract treatment i am also looking into mitotempo to go with mitoq andaspirin a combination with huge promise you are so kind to seek to help methank you sir hi dale my apologies for the delayed response there are several other items that have come to my attention in recent times one  the therapy involving anti neoplastons developed by a dr burzynski has shown great promise especially in the successful remission of cancer types that are notorious for their resistance to treatment like astrocytoma  brain cancer as i understand it our immune systems have a component that detects and attacks abnormal cells before they can develop into tumors he extracts these anti neoplastons from the patients blood treats them in a way that multiplies their numbers then re injects them back into the patients body his success has caused an uproar in the pharmaceutical industry which has tried to block implementation of this therapy through their hacks in the fda for nearly twenty years because it would make chemotherapy and radiation obsolete costing them billions of dollars in revenue theres a very remarkable movie about the doctors work called simply the burzynski movie you can find it easily in a google search also ive heard positive mention made of a supplement called dichloroacetate from what i understand it was banned in the us just as it began to show great oncological promise in humans but it can still be obtained from sources in china as a treatment for cancer in pets a   pure product is recommended by those who have used it but i cannot say from any personal experience if it works as effectively as is claimed finally let me say without being preachy or dogmatic that i will hold you up in prayer for putting this problem behind you once and for all warm regards mark also see the truth about cancer information ty bollinger the symposium he sponsored a couple of weeks ago brought together many different natural cancer doctors all types what they all understand is that there are many natural cures for cancer and they each talked about their own ideasprotocols to help people overcome their cancers without having to endure the traditional treatments ty bollinger got involved in researching what forms of natural cancer treatments were out there after his father died of cancer had i known about this i would have had my own father seeing one of these doctors im sure thats at least part of it excellent work janet these mass murderers are definitely suppressing the cure for cancer worse yet they know how not to get cancer because they know the covert chemical and biological methods of depopulation and are protecting themselves and their families while poisoning the rest of us into sterility and early death jack layton died of aggressive prostate cancer i think they killed him as most men with prostate cancer die of old ago first my father ignored signs for years and when diagnosed it was pretty advanced he was   when diagnosed he is now almost   with excellent psa tests they have ways to selectively give the enemy cancer yep just ask the relatives of the six leaders of south american countries who died of cancer in a single decade a south american organization has sent a formal letter alleging the usa was behind it it is just the bush clinton rockefeller rothschild et al who do not die of cancer or anything else come to think of it nice dot connecting work janet the cancer killing properties of cannabis have been known for decades perhaps theyre all taking cbd or some similar secret to the rest of us compound its also a known fact the cia can inject cancer into anyone easily its simple undetectable silent wet work if youre not a super hurry to get rid of a socialist they tried it out on bob marley for sure and who knows how many others it beats a bullet in the head for many reasons and situations damn good point perhaps its not so much a cure which the elites have found but rather a lifestyle and dietary measures that prevent cancer in the first place possibly also less exposure to cancer causing environmental and so called therapeutic synthetic chemicals watch glyphosate which is saturating many gmo based foods is a carcinogen it is also an antibiotic and chemical mimick of glycine the non essential amino acid related to fast proliferating cancer growth glyphosate was recently also found in vaccines almost all tested by dr samsel so not only gmos chemicals sugar lack of oxygen contribute to cancer but also vaccines indirectly through glyphosate and directly through many other toxins among others formaldehyde one of the most potent carcinogens yes this article is great as it sheds the light on who knows what and why some people i call victims have to die of cancer the article should mention the jimmy carter case who defeated cancer at an advanced age in a matter of weeks or a few months how did that happen he left the country to get cured here are important facts on cancer that must be shared and spead vaccines are a major cancer causing weapon why else would they push it so hard dr mary ended badlyas did lhojudy is still alive and well but in hiding theyaredespicable add steve jobs to your list his birth father was syrian he would be opposed to the nsa desired back door to the products in america cancer is predominately caused by smoking and the consumption of animal products animal products are loaded with hormones and endotoxins they lack fiber phytochemicals and antioxidants they induce obesity and impair blood flow which prevents the immune system from working property they cause inflammation which is another load on the immune system the reason why africa and india have such low cancer rates is clear just look at their annual meat consumption the same with meningitis have u ever seen or heard of a royalrich person having been mutilated by meningitis i for one dont looks like there are diseases especially made for the sheeple dr rath is a snake oil salesman there is no doubt vit c is important to health but he has made claims not backed by research and widely criticized as well as being judged against for deceptive claims etc in courts his methods are unethical his claims hype his goal to make money selling vitamins which is his source of income in south africa he took aids patients off their medication basically kidnapped them and told them if they got sick not to go to the hospital but back to his clinic many died i am into natural cures but people like dr mercola and rath use natural remedies as a form of conning people to sell supplements i am not against natural remedies or vitamins and supplements i am on a natural treatment so far not working and my diet for   years is full of foods loaded with lysine proline and vit c i have eaten foods rich in lysine for   years including lentils soy etc all high in lysine i am taking large doses of vit c and soy which i like the centenarians of okinawa eat soy everyday my entire diet is anti cancer and has been for most of my life i avoid quacks and doctors who make their money selling products they make exaggerated claims for i find an ethical and medical conflict of interestin promoting a controversial treatment and then selling the products for it i do not disagree that high doses of vit c may help fight cancer and i am taking high doses but it hasnt had an effect sadly nor has a lifetime of eating tofu and tempeh which are rich in proline and other anti cancer compounds i am   had my prostate removed   yrs ago and had   yrs of no cancer but it has come back at a low psa level now   but growing the last thing a cancer patient needs is a conventional doctor who knows nothing of the relationship of diet and health or a quack doctor making unsupportable exaggerations about products he himself sells thanks for the link michele the disqus notification didnt come through when you posted this i only noticed this because james peters big pharma pro vaccine shill popped up again to reply to my comment from   weeks ago with his usual copypaste nonsense anyway im familiar with rife and believe he was onto one aspect of cancer i took gradmed oncology courses studying cancer at the genetic and molecular levels this stuff is right up my alley rife was definitely a genius thanks for the nudge to dig deeper into his work
2,walmart surrenders to shariah law in this disgusting way according to recent reports a wal mart in ohio has given in to muslim demands and started offering meat that has been prepared halal style this is just another example of america being forced to accommodate islamic shariah law offering benefits to the minority rather than to the needs of the majority unfortunately halal meats are often associated with methods of brutal slaughter in fact one miami student has decided to speak out against the organization for condoning the inhumane treatment of these animals the root of the problem stems from the fact that oxford assistant professor tareq hasan khan paired with the muslim student association msa of miami university to create a petition demanding that wal mart begin providing meats slaughtered in a manner acceptable by halal standards although the petition only received   signatures the superstore decided to implement the controversial change anyway according to the definition held within the quran halal livestock must be slaughtered by slitting the throat of the beast and bleeding the animal out what do you think of wal marts decision to allow such practices
3,government plan would transform israel into the worlds first cashless societymichael snyder in fact it has been reported that israeli officials believe that cash is bad because it fuels the underground economy and allows people to avoid paying taxes it is hoped that requiring most transactions to be conducted in cash will reduce crime and help balance the national budget and once   or   percent of all transactions are cashless it will not be difficult for the israeli government or any other government to go the rest of the way and ban cash transactions altogether but is a cashless society actually desirable this is a question that people all over the world will have to start asking as governments increasingly restrict the use of cash back in september it was announced that the israeli government had formed a committee toexamine ways to eliminate cash from the israeli economy the committee has had quite a few months to examine these issues and now they have come back with their recommendations just this week we learned thata three phase plan is being proposed so what do the specifics of the plan look like well there will be very strict limits on the use of cash for individuals and businesses any violations will be considered criminal offenses and all israeli banks will be required to issue debit cards to all account holders in conjunction with these new restrictions israeli banks would be required to provide all account holders with debit cards to further promote electronic payments but of course this move toward a cashless society is not just happening in israel in sweden it is estimated that just   percent of all transactions involve cash at this point in fact according to an article in the washington post some swedish banks do not handle cash at all anymore and the us is starting to move in that direction as well according to a study conducted by mastercard approximately  percent of all consumer transactions in the united states are now cashless but isnt there a downside to all of this just about everything that we do in life involves money so yes a government can track electronic payments to make sure taxes are being paid and money laundering is not happening but it would also enable a government to do so much more if a government can track all of your transactions it will essentially be able to monitor everywhere you go and pretty much keep track of virtually everything that you do if you doubt this just try to live without any money some time you wont get very far without putting some gas in your vehicle and without being able to buy food you will get hungry pretty quickly are you starting to understand this is why governments love the idea of moving toward a cashless society it would give them an immensely powerful surveillance tool so let us hope that this does not happen in israel or anywhere else in the world either this article first appeared here at the american dream michael snyder is a writer speaker and activist who writes and edits his own blogs the american dream and economic collapse blog follow him on twitter here

4,tampa saddled with the worst run defense in the nfl and a     record coach raheem morris decided monday night to relieve jim bates as defensive coordinator and take over the defensive play calling duties bates   will remain with the team at least through the end of the season in a consulting role breaking down film and helping morris on game day from the coaching box morris is expected to immediately return the bucs to their tampa   scheme which will allow their undersized defensive linemen to take advantage of their quickness rather than penalize them for a lack of size morris and general manager mark dominik met until late monday to discuss the organizational shift one day after the bucs were routed by unbeaten new orleans     one of the worst home defeats in club history under bates tampa bays defense is ranked  th overall in the nfl and last against the run allowing    yards per game only the detroit lions have given up more points than the    per game allowed by the bucs this season bates becomes the second coordinator hired by morris and dominik to leave since the start of the season tampa bay fired offensive coordinator jeff jagodzinski   days before the regular season saying he had trouble calling plays and that his passing scheme wasnt nfl quality they replaced him with quarterbacks coach greg olson bates who ran successful defenses in green bay and miami faced a tall order trying to replace monte kiffin the long time defensive coordinator who branded the tampa two defense under kiffin the bucs finished among the top   defenses   times in   seasons but kiffin announced he was leaving the bucs last december to join his son lane at the university of tennessee after that announcement the bucs went from     and a possible no   seed in the nfc to losing four straight games and missing the playoffs bates attempted to change the bucs old     scheme which utilized undersized penetrating defensive linemen and fast linebackers to one that requires larger defensive linemen and linebackers but to bates defense the bucs never really changed personnel to fit bates scheme consequently the bucs have been unable to stop the run and have given up big plays in the passing game opposing quarterbacks have a    rating under bates the bucs defense has yielded    yards per game and a whopping    yards per play almost every area of the defense has fallen well short of the bucs standard under bates tackling has been poor the pass rush has been mostly non existent with only   sacks this season six of them coming against green bay the coverage has been suspect particularly early in the season the bucs have given up nine pass plays of   yards or more simply returning to their tampa   roots wont cure the bucs of all their problems on defense though the move is likely to be well received by veteran players like chris hovan barrett ruud and ronde barber the bucs dont have many playmakers on that side of the ball the bucs have six games remaining including four against the nfc south and own the worst record in the nfl tampa bay plays at atlanta on sunday

3,the stock market in japan is collapsingmichael snyder those who have been waiting for a full blown stock market collapse may be about to get their wish japan is absolutely drowning in debt their central bank is printing money like crazy and the japanese population is aging rapidly as far as economic fundamentals go there is very little good news as far as japan is concerned so will an asian financial collapse precede the next great financial crisis in the united states that is what some have been predicting and it starting to look increasingly likely what happened to the nikkei early on tuesday was absolutely breathtaking the following is how bloomberg described the carnage at the end of january   japanese stocks trailed only portugal for the biggest rally among developed markets now the nikkei   stock average is leading declines slumping    percent last month and today capping a   percent drop from its dec   peak losses snowballed in tokyo during a global retreat that has erased    trillion from equity values worldwide this year amid signs of slower growth in china and stimulus cuts by the us federal reserve the fed created this bubble by pumping trillions of fresh dollars into the global financial system and now they are bursting this bubble by starting to cut off the flow of easy money this is something that i warned would happen when the fed decided to taper and now rbs is warning of a market bloodbath unless the federal reserve immediately stops tapering most americans simply do not realize that our financial markets no longer resemble a free market system instead they are highly manipulated and distorted by the central banks and the trillions of dollars of hot money that the fed has poured into the global financial system has infectedvirtually every financial market on earth on wall street they call it hot moneythat seemingly endless flow of cash that goes to the most profitable country du jourbut in the real economy its gone cold that hot money has come mostly in the form of a low yielding us dollar which investors have borrowed en masse to fund investments in other higher yielding currencies across the globe the so called carry trade has helped fuel an investment bonanza across the world that has boosted risk assets thanks primarily to the us federal reserves easy money policy but with the fed tiptoeing away from what initially was an   billion a month infusion of liquidity investors are beginning to prepare themselves for a world of rising rates in which the endless cash flow to emerging market economies begins to ebb then cease we never fixed any of the fundamental problems that caused the last financial crisis instead the fed seemed to think that the solution to any problem was just to create more money it was an incredibly stupid approach and now our fundamental problems are worse than everas marc faber recently noted total credit as a percent of the global economy is now   percent higher than it was at the start of the economic crisis in   we have had rapidly escalating household debt especially in emerging economies and resource economies like canada and australia and we have come to a point where household debt has become burdensome on the systemthat is where an economic slowdown follows so what comes next well unless the fed or other central banks intervene we are probably going to have even more carnage at least that is what dennis gartman the editor and publisher of the gartman letter told cnbc on tuesday i just think youre going to have a very severe very substantive and really quite ugly correction that will probably make a lot of people wail and gnash their teeth before its done other analysts share his pessimism according to doug short the vice president of research at advisor perspectives the us stock market still looks   overvalued most sobering of all is what richard russell is saying in his   years of writing about financial issues he has never been so filled with foreboding regarding what lies ahead id be lying if i said that i wasnt worried about the way things are going frankly im truly scared for myself my family and the nation i have the sinking feeling that the stock market is on the edge of a crash if that happens investor sentiment will turn quickly bearish and the bear market will start feeding on itself ironically the recent action occurred in the face of almost insane bullishness on the part of the crowd and on the part of investors obviously smart heads and institutional money managers know that the us is semi dead in the water and all the talk about an improving economy is just wishes and hopes bernankes dream of a flourishing new economy improving without the need of the feds help is an idle dream ive been writing about the stock market for over   years and i cant remember a time when i was so filled with foreboding regarding what lies ahead the primary trend of the market like the tide of the ocean is irresistible and waits for no man what scares me the most in this current situation is that i see no clear island of safety you can read the rest of his very disturbing remarks right here us stocks may not totally crash this week this month or even this year but without a doubt a day of reckoning is coming as a society our total consumer business and government debt is now equivalent to approximately  percent of gdp the only way that the game can continue is to keep pumping up the debt bubble even more those that foolishly still have lots of money in the stock market better hope that the federal reserve decides to intervene in a major way very soon because if they dont there is a very good chance that we could indeed have a market bloodbath on our hands this article first appeared here at the economic collapse blog

3,christmas tree bombers appeal puts fbi entrapment in spotlightby derrick broze on wednesday the ninth circuit court of appeals heard arguments related to surveillance and possible entrapment of mohamed mohamud the man convicted of attemptingto blow up a christmas tree lighting ceremony in portland oregon in   mohamud a somali american student who was   at the time of the incident was told he would be participating in a bombing with two al qaida recruiters the recruiters ended up being informants for the federal bureau of investigation and the bomb was a fake in   mohamud would be sentenced to   years in prison the arrest and sentence lead many activists and members of the muslim community to question whether the fbi had gone too far and possibly created a terrorist out of thin air courthouse news reports on the appeal from his indictment through his appeals including in a brief filed february with the ninth circuit public defenders have argued that their client was entrapped by sophisticated fbi agents who preyed on mr mohamuds known vulnerabilities currying support from the electronic frontier foundation and the case along with the american civil liberties union the case has also sparked much controversy around section   of the amended foreign intelligence surveillance act this law allows the government to track phone and emails without warrants a three judge panel listened to mohamuds appealand arguments fromassistant us attorney kelly zusman whodefendedthe governmentsuse of informants zusman argued that mohamud had long been in contact with a student at portland state university who was wanted by the saudi kingdom for terrorism links us circuit judge carlos bea asked the prosecutor to show in the record where mr mohamud evinces a predisposition to commit a terrorist act prior to his first meeting with undercover agent youssef zusman said mohamud praised terrorist actions and apparentlyhad been thinking about committing an act of violent jihad since he was   still chief deputy federal public defender stephen sady believes mohamuds casewas marred by an array of constitutional errors mohamuds appeal centers around the illegal use of section   of the fisa act the ninth circuit will be the first appeals court to rule on what type of surveillance is allowed by the controversial section the fisa act is absolutely an extremely dangerous tool for agencies of the government but it is the idea that the government may be entrapping or directly create terrorists that deserves a closer look almost nothing about this scenario was true the cell phone wasnt connected to the toggle switch the detonation cords werent wired to an explosive device the blue drums werent filled with diesel saturated fertilizer but harmless grass seed mohamed wasnt a member of al qaeda counterpunch reported in   of somali origin he was a troubled college dropout from beaverton oregon home of nike youssef wasnt a member of al qaeda hussein was not one of al qaedas top bomb makers youssef and hussein were not really arrested and neither was charged with being part of a terrorist plot youssef and hussein were both federal agents counterpunch also noted and court records show that mohamed mohamud did not seek out the bomb plotters they found him and seduced the young man into joining their conspiracy in the end it seems the infamous portland christmas tree bomb plot was scripted by the fbi however its important to note that this practice has been happening for years the fbis involvement in domestic terror plots and the ever thinner line between catching and creating terrorists has not been completely lost on the major media outlets commenting on the situation rolling stones rick perlstein wrote a piece entitledhow fbi entrapment is inventing terrorists and letting bad guys off the hookquestioning the motives of the bureau the new york times even seemed to take a bold stance with david shiplers pieceterrorist plots hatched by the fbi which stated this is legal but is it legitimate without the fbi would the culprits commit violence on their own is cultivating potential terrorists the best use of the manpower designed to find the real ones judging by their official answers the fbi and the justice department are sure of themselves too sure perhaps the article details the way entrapment efforts disguised as counter terrorism usually start with an individual making comments to friends or through online postings before being approached by an informant who encourages them to take their speech to the next level since    these types of stings have become commonplace so much so that in america today merely discussing the possibility of violence with an informant can warrant an arrest recorded conversations show contrary to claims by the justice department that suspects are not always warned about the consequences of their actions and are in fact sometimes told by their informants to continue their efforts aninvestigation by mother jones and the investigative reporting program at uc berkeleyexamined prosecutions of   defendants in terrorism related cases the investigation revealed that the largest portion of the fbis    billion budget is currently directed to counter terrorism it is that bloated budget which has allowed the fbi to entrap many other people who may or may not have ever been involved in committing crimes shortly after mohamuds arrest there alsowas the case of the cleveland   in october   the fbi sent an unnamed informant known as a confidential human source or chs to infiltrate occupy cleveland in hopes of finding potential terrorists the fbi sent in a career criminal convicted of at least six charges including robbery to investigate the occupy group and potential criminal activity and threats involving anarchists who would be attending the chs found five men with anti government sentiments and began encouraging them to consider various acts of terrorism under the encouragement of the chs the group plotted to blow up a bridge in ohio on april     the chs reportedly took the men from discussing knocking down bank signs to discussing buying c  explosives promising them fake license plates and alibis to soothe their fears of being arrested and sent to guantanamo the chs repeatedly pressed the men to consider buying the explosives in the weeks leading up to the arrest one of the   connor stevens was actuallyrecorded rejecting violent tactics saying its actually harder to be non violent than it is to do stuff like that eventually though the group was persuaded to buy explosives and upon attempting to make use of the dummy explosives which had been provided by another fbi informant they were arrested the men received sentences ranging from six to   years with the recent shootings and high tensions it is extremely important to be on guard and remain cautious despite a need for righteous anger we cannot allow ourselves to be swept up in the heat of the moment and stray from the strategy of peaceful non compliance resistance and building of alternatives if someone approaches you with a braindeadscheme to blow something up tell them to shove it and immediately remove yourself from the situation we need a culture of security if we are going to overcome snitches and the prying eyes and ears of big brother derrick broze is an

3,media matrix an ancient tibetan perspective on the evening network newsby jon rappoport for the early tibetan adepts the void was a vital concept stripped of its metaphysical baggage and embroidery void was the place where creating stopped the constant noise of existence went away the ongoing parade of inner thoughts sentiments propensitiesvanished for as long as a person wanted to stay there and experience the greatest vacation hed ever known if he could handle it but humans felt a great need to avoid the void they demanded activity flow information they eventually sank to the level of passivityand then they simply wanted input more input and still more input from an authoritative unimpeachable external source hence from the earliest societies onward there was a thing called the news it was updated it was ongoing it was forever priests delivered it kings delivered it their minions delivered it if the news stopped people felt anxiety which at bottom was a fear of void there is much more to say about the tibetans and their understanding of void and its twin ongoing creation but ill save that for another time now in these times the global population has television news the imitations of life called anchors are the arbiters how they speak how they look how they themselves experience emotionall this is planted deep in the minds of the viewers much of the world cant imagine the evening news could look and sound any other way thats how solid the long term brainwashing is the elite anchors from john daly in the early days of television all the way to lester holt and scott pelley have set the style they define the genre the anchor taps into and mimics that part of the audiences psyche that wants smooth delivery of superficial cause and effect in the void of course cause and effect dissolve the network anchor is the wizard of is he keeps explaining what is heres something that is and then over here we have something else that is and now just in a new thing that is he lays down miles of is concrete to pave over deeper uncomfortable truth ultimately he is paving over void on air the anchor is neutral a castratus a eunuch this is a time honored ancient tradition the eunuch by his diminished condition has the trust of the ruler he guards the emperors inner sanctum he acts as a buffer between his master and the people he applies the royal seal to official documents all expressed shades of emotion occur and are managed within that persona of the dependable court eunuch the anchor who can move the closest to the line of being human without actually arriving there is the champion these days it was until his downfall brian williams the vibrating string between eunuch and human is the frequency that makes an anchor great think cronkite chet huntley edward r murrow huntley was a just a touch too masculine so they teamed him up with david brinkley a medium boiled egg brinkley supplied twinkles of comic relief there are other reasons for voice neutrality of the anchor neutrality conveys a sense of science we did the experiment in the lab and this is how it turned out television news is really all segue all the time thats what it comes down to the word segue pronounced segway refers to a transition from one thing to another a blend ed mcmahon once referred to johnny carson as the prince of blends because carson could tell a clunker of a joke step on it three times and still move to the next joke without losing his audience television news is very serious business a reporter who cant handle segues is dead in the water hes a gross liability the good anchors can take two stories that have no connection whatsoever and create a sense of smooth transition brian williams could say the planes were recalled later in the afternoonand a man was cut in two in a horrific accident in idaho todayand in seattle smile three people reported seeing turtles falling from the sky and it works the segue works the blends from one story to another seem reasonable somehow the networks basically have on a daily basis radically fragmented stories and they need an anchor who can do the blends the segues and get away with it to promote the sense of one continuous flow so the audience doesnt say this is just an odd collection of surreal moments this is salvador dali on my television screen the news is all segue all the time the voice of the anchor is the non stop blending machine that ties all news stories together thats why the elite network stars earn their paychecks its often been said of certain actors he could read from the phone book and youd listen well an elite anchor can hold the viewers mind as he reads a sentence from the phone book another one from a car repair manual a third from a cookbook and a fourth from a funeral home brochure without stopping and afterward the viewer would have no questions the news is surreal because the stories are mostly fools gold to begin with and theyre unrelated theyre rocks lying around the anchor picks them up and invents the illusion of one flowing stream this is what the audience wants the news feels like a story it feels like unity it feels like a stage play or a movie it feels when all is said and done good you cant pull just anyone off the street and have him describe car crashes murders storms threats of war political squabbles   cats living in a one room apartment a new piece of medicare legislation genitalia picture tweets and the dedication of a new library while keeping the audience in a light trance katie couric couldnt do it people were waiting for her to break out into an attack of perky and giggle and cross her legs diane sawyer had her bad nights she seemed to be affecting somber personal grief as her basic segue thread scott pelley is competent but he has his off moments too when hes suddenly sitting like a surgeon ready to signal the anesthesiologist to clamp a mask on your face before he cuts into your stomach whereas a true and authentic version of the news would go something like this well folks just now i moved from a tornado in kansas to the removal of restrictions on condom sales and im blending directly into penguins in antarctica im doing salvador dali and youre not noticing a thing the anchor is basically saying to the audience im a few feet inside your personal landscape your mind feeding you all the turns in the river and ill always be herepapering over the void elite anchors invent and maintain certain tones of voice certain rhythms certain cadences certain variations of musical pitch in order to sustain the sense of continuity theyre mechanics of voice they can know theyre actors on television but they can believe in direct contradiction theyre delivering the truth okay look the producer says to the veteran actor hes interviewing for the lead in a billion dollar production called the news this may sound strange but youre going to have to do normal as its never been done before thats what the

4,global warming talks were suspended for hours monday because of a walkout by developing countries as rich and poor nations struggled to reconcile the divisions that have dominated international climate policy for decades the largest group of developing nations known as the g   brought the un sponsored talks to a halt here as they accused the united states and other industrialized countries of forsaking the kyoto protocol the climate agreement that currently imposes emission limits on nearly all of the worlds developed nations the conferences danish chairwoman connie hedegaard resolved the issue by establishing a series of small working groups where ministers could tackle key issues such as global emissions targets and money to help poor countries cope with climate change tim wirth president of the un foundation said the delay would not undermine the possibility of a deal which is supposed to be finalized friday when more than   world leaders convene in copenhagen they cant come here and say this didnt work  said wirth a former senator and undersecretary of state for global affairs in the clinton administration we always get down to the last minute  and at the end of this you end up with a package but the shape of the package remained unclear as some participants expressed growing frustration at the pace of the negotiations one delegate from a major developing country who asked not to be identified because of the sensitive nature of the talks said there was no longer time for open ended discussions now is not the time for consultation he said adding that none of the major countries had shifted their positions since negotiators arrived a week ago we wasted a whole sunday exchanging the same rhetoric ive heard it all before im bored to death the us special climate envoy todd stern said in a briefing that there are legitimate concerns that people have anxiety about how the process runs about transparency and inclusiveness and all of those things but he said the clock is definitely ticking sort of like a big hourglass thats running down right now so any time thats lost it is unhelpful one of the key developments that could change the negotiating dynamic would be a long term financing offer from industrialized nations but that has yet to happen european union leaders will meet wednesday to finalize their offer and japanese prime minister yukio hatoyama is unlikely to announce his countrys funding package before his arrival in copenhagen in the meantime developing country representatives such as bernaditas de castro muller    who comes from the philippines but negotiates for the g   as a member of the sudanese delegation    questioned monday whether rich nations are doing enough to compensate for their historical contribution to global warming we are trying very hard to get the best equitable deal in this process muller said no matter how small the country they are still a part of this planet we have to be all consulted while negotiators debated who bears responsibility for curbing greenhouse gas emissions advocates released a series of scientific reports aimed at conveying the urgent need to act on global warming former vice president al gore delivered a lecture to a packed crowd in a side event in the bella center talking about a report he and the norwegian government commissioned that shows the rate at which the greenland ice cap has been shrinking has tripled in the last   years new computer modeling also suggests summer sea ice in the arctic ocean could disappear as early as   separately the international union for the conservation of nature issued a report monday highlighting how   species    including the staghorn coral and australias koala    will probably be hardest hit by climate change the koala for example faces malnutrition and eventually starvation because the eucalyptus leaves it depends on will lose nutritional quality as levels of carbon dioxide rise the image of a forlorn looking polar bear on a tiny ice floe has become the publics image of climate change in nature but the impact reaches species in nearly every habitat in the worlds wild places said steven sanderson president and chief executive of the wildlife conservation society
1,this us has publicly threatened retaliatory hacks against russia for weeks now based on allegations that russia may have been involved in certain hacks related to democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton russia denied involvement and the us government has been unable to produce any concrete evidence of russian involvement  vice president joe biden went so far as to confirm the us had informed vladimir putin that the us would conduct revenge attacks at the time of our choosing the time may ultimately be americas election day according to officials familiar with the situation  nbc news has reported seeing top secret documents from these officials detailing potential us plans to launch military cyber attacks against russias civilian infrastructure with the documents claiming advanced us cyber weapons were prepared to take down russias entire electricity grid all telecommunications networks and the kremlins own command systems  the reports are emerging in the context of us officials speculating that russia might launch cyber attacks against the us during the election to try to disrupt it since they offered no evidence for this either it raises concerns that the us is simply setting up a pretext for timing its own attacks around them  that officials are trying to assure the media that such huge attacks would only be launched in retaliation offers little comfort given the administrations willingness to claim anything and everything remotely election related and embarrassing to the clinton campaign as a russian plot  such massive us attacks on russian infrastructure regardless of the pretext would likely be seen as an act of war the us has made clear in the past they would regard cyber attacks of a large enough scale as equivalent to conventional military attacks and given the scale that it being discussed its hard to imagine russia would not react similarly

4,chuck anderson is in washington on wednesday to save the thing that bit off his arm it happened in june   when he was swimming in the gulf of mexico off alabama a seven foot bull shark came up from underneath knocking him out of the water it snapped off four of andersons fingers chomped at his belly then ripped away his right arm below the elbow the attack almost killed anderson   it also turned him into an advocate for one of the most fearsome fish in the sea theyre vicious and theyre mean anderson said but you know i dont have any right to be angry at the shark anderson is in town for what could be the largest gathering of american shark attack survivors to date    and certainly one of the oddest lobbying blitzes ever on capitol hill at least nine other survivors plan to press the senate to put new restrictions on fishing for sharks some species of which are in deep decline thirty two percent of the sharks and rays that live in the open ocean were classified as threatened this year by the international union for the conservation of nature scientists fear that ocean ecosystems could be knocked out of whack by the loss of their apex predators the   shark survivors offer a wildly counter intuitive story for them the terrifying seconds they spent as prey have created a forgiving even admiring bond with the oceans man eaters the tiny group was organized by a survivor who works for the nonprofit pew environment group who began calling others like her to see if they might want to offer their unique perspective and lobby for protections some balked but several signed on and pew agreed to fund their outreach well finally be heard said al brenneka   who lost his right arm to a seven foot lemon shark in   who should speak up for the sharks better than the people that the sharks have spoken to themselves shark bites are rare in the united states since   there have been an average of   per year and only a handful of fatalities at last count the florida based international shark attack file calculated the odds of an attack as   in every    million beach visits at the same time sharks have been devastated by our desire to eat them    in soup the trade in fins for shark fin soup a delicacy in asia has been blamed for heavy fishing of many species others are slaughtered for the rest of their meat or killed accidentally by fishermen setting out nets or hooks for tuna and marlin because of all this its often said that sharks have more to fear from us than we from sharks thats true only most of the time i just figured im done said mike degruy   a marine biologist who was bitten by a grey reef shark while diving in the pacific ocean atoll of enewetak in   spewing blood degruy paddled to his boat through shark filled waters for   minutes speculating calmly about where the next one would hit him if i thought i might have made it then i would have panicked degruy reached the boat and eventually a hospital in hawaii i still to this day do not understand why i was not eaten said degruy who lost some function in one hand i must taste like crap other survivors tell stories with similar elements a sudden stunningly muscular attack lots of blood and little pain and a mind cleared by adrenaline or fatalism i remember thinking wow this is supposed to hurt but there was no pain whatsoever said anderson a former high school football coach who was training for a triathlon when the shark hit him like a fullback it was on its fourth pass that the shark bit down on andersons right arm he heard a pop which was the shark taking his arm and he was free for anderson    a naturally upbeat person who has returned to triathlons with a customized paddle on his elbow    forgiveness came easy he says he knew the risks of swimming in the sharks habitat if we want to go out and swim in a safer environment we can go to the ymca but for others hatred and fear came first brenneka whose attack made him go from a righty to a lefty took his anger out on the animals directly he would go deep sea fishing and use a powerhead    a bullet fired from a long tube    to kill the sharks he hooked he saved the jaws and ate the meat but then brenneka said he went diving to see sharks did research on them and concluded that the one that attacked him wasnt at fault the journey took years he said slowed down by the anti shark mania that followed the release of jaws theyre only doing what comes natural brenneka said in   he founded a group called shark attack survivors many victims seek meaning in their attack by trying to understand sharks better and come to respect them it is just something that you have to face is it was my responsibility  he said debbie salamone was walking in waist deep water at cape canaveral national seashore when a shark seized her heel severing the achilles tendon she had been a committed environmentalist before the attack but after if they proposed to pave over half the ocean for a strip mall and a parking lot i would have been fine with it she said salamone hasnt gone far enough to take responsibility for the bite but says she came to see the attack as a deep gory test of her resolve to help the environment including    maybe especially    the parts of it that bite she left a job in newspapers and now works full time at the nonprofit pew environment group sitting in a caribou coffee in downtown washington this spring she had an idea maybe other survivors would want to fight for sharks too two survivors whom she called said they were still too angry she said the rest said yes this visit suddenly became the biggest event for survivors that anyone could remember were seriously scarred  and some of us are missing limbs and we have every right to hate sharks salamone said sketching out the group spiel for senators for wednesday i think the message is if we can see the value in saving sharks everyone should theyre here to lobby for a senate bill that would outlaw shark finning    a practice where fishermen slice off a sharks fin and toss the rest of its carcass overboard    in us waters the bill has already passed the house and has the support of federal fisheries managers who say it would make existing shark protections easier to enforce it wont save the worlds shark populations scientists say finning is largely done by overseas fishing crews in the united states it is already outlawed in the atlantic ocean and the gulf and largely curtailed in the pacific monday night the group met in a conference room at the pew groups downtown dc headquarters to tell shark survivor jokes anderson said his only revenge on the shark was the timex watch it swallowed    that thing went off at    every morning and talk about the reactions to their scars degruy said his experience gave him an appreciation of what it is like to be a shark seriously injured and left helpless in the water weve been finned he said of his injuries its not a good thing
1,over the course of this years us presidential election which has been nothing if not bizarre some have repeatedly speculated that the election may not actually happen at all if an opportunely timed terrorist attack or other major event occurred at just the right moment leading to a suspension of the november election now these theories appear to have more credence as sources within us intelligence have contacted pat milton a cbs news senior investigative producer warning him that terrorist attacks in three us states are highly likely come this monday the day before the us election us intelligence has allegedly alerted joint terrorism task forces that al qaeda not isis could be planning attacks in new york texas and virginia no specific locations within those three states were mentioned   us authorities are said to be taking the threat seriously though cbs news  sources stress that the threat is still being assessed and its credibility has yet to be confirmed according to cbs  counter terrorism officials were alerted to the threat out of an abundance of caution   earlier this week there were also warnings that polling places could be seen as attractive targets for lone wolf attackers by individuals motivated by violent extremist ideologies sovereign citizen or other extremist activity this has led federal law enforcement to plan for several worst case scenarios one fbi official told cbs    the counter terrorism and homeland security communities remain vigilant and well postured to defend against attacks here in the united states the fbi working with our federal state and local counterparts shares and assesses intelligence on a daily basis and will continue to work closely with law enforcement and intelligence community partners to identify and disrupt any potential threat to public safety   however whats interesting here is that the terror threat is coming from al qaeda as opposed to the islamic state in the syrian civil war the us has been actively helping al qaeda there grouping their syrian branch  the al nusra front  in with the moderate rebels they support therefore al qaedas ability to launch attacks within the us has been directly aided by us intelligence making this announcement incredibly suspect   its also worth pointing out that al qaeda since its inception has been a product of the us intelligence community in the  s they were essentially created by the us to fight the soviets in afghanistan ever since they have conveniently been used as the justification for an expansion of us wars abroad and the elimination of civil liberties domestically   it is also interesting that the threat is al qaeda and not the islamic state the islamic state has been the terrorist bogeyman of recent years and their involvement in any threat real or imagined is useful justification for escalating us involvement in syria it seems highly likely that the islamic state was left out due to recent revelations from wikileaks showing that their funding comes from the very same entities that donate millions to the clinton foundation   it is also worth noting that if a terrorist attack does come to pass it will be a big help for hillary hillary has been under siege in recent weeks due to wikileaks near constant releases of her campaign chairs emails but also due to the fbis mutiny which led them to re open a probe into clintons use of a private email server any terror attack would give clinton the opportunity to gain political ground by promoting her aggressive foreign policy aims in syria and the rest of the middle east

4,the hole in the ozone layer    are making the current one worse the chemicals called hydrofluorocarbons hfcs were introduced widely in the  s to replace ozone depleting gases used in air conditioners refrigerators and insulating foam they worked the earths protective shield seems to be recovering but researchers say whats good for ozone is bad for climate change in the atmosphere these replacement chemicals act like super greenhouse gases with a heat trapping power that can be    times that of carbon dioxide now scientists say the world must find replacements for the replacements    or these super emissions could cancel out other efforts to stop global warming whatever targets you thought you were going to make said david fahey a physicist at the national oceanic and atmospheric administration it will be undermined by the fact that you have  additional emissions that you hadnt planned on the colorless odorless replacement chemicals enter the atmosphere in tiny amounts often leaking out of refrigerators and air conditioners or escaping when those machines break and are improperly dumped they now account for about   percent of the climate warming power of us emissions according to the environmental protection agency that is still far less than carbon dioxide which is produced by burning fossil fuels and accounts for about   percent of the problem and it is less than the roughly   percent of warming from methane which comes from sources including farm animals and decomposing trash but in recent weeks these obscure gases have been given a higher profile in the carbon dominated debate on climate change last month a group of scientists published a paper projecting that if unchecked the emissions would rise rapidly over the next   years by   they found the amount of super greenhouse gases in the atmosphere might be equal to six or more years worth of carbon dioxide emissions and last week diplomats met in geneva to discuss ideas for a worldwide reduction in hfcs you have this moment when you could nip this problem in the bud and avoid this very large growth of a dangerous chemical said david doniger policy director at the natural resources defense councils climate center from geneva now in the next couple of years is when you have to do this the roots of the problem go back to the  s when scientists theorized that chemicals called chlorofluorocarbons cfcs were slowly eroding stratospheric ozone that was a dangerous thing since the ozone layer protects the planet from harmful uv radiation in   governments signed the montreal protocol agreeing to reduce cfcs since then this agreement has been a kind of bureaucratic miracle ninety six percent of ozone depleting substances have been phased out according to the united nations the united nations says there is still a hole in the ozone above the south pole but global ozone levels are expected to return to their pre   level by about   if this were a soccer team  its won every single game said durwood zaelke president of the institute for governance and sustainable development thats astounding in the international environmental field it worked because chemists engineered substitutes for cfcs new gases without the propensity to chemically unlock ozone molecules the replacements could still chill cold cuts and chevrolets    in refrigerators and under car hoods they are compressed and uncompressed in a process that sucks heat out of passing air but the chemicals strong bonds also cause them to act as heat sponges in earths atmosphere absorbing energy from the sun and keeping it from being reflected out into space in the blanket created by heat trapping gases that makes them especially heavy strands pound for pound theyre much more powerful than co  you know    hundreds or thousands of times more powerful said noaa physicist fahey exactly how powerful depends on the makeup of the gases one common in fridges and auto air conditioners lasts   to   years in the atmosphere and has    times the global warming impact of carbon dioxide another has a   year life and    times the power according to the recent paper there will soon be many more of them as developing countries become more prosperous and their people buy vehicles and air conditioners even if the world makes significant progress in reducing carbon dioxide and methane    still a big if since recent negotiations on the topic have produced little    the scientists said the growth in hfcs could undo a significant part of their work internationally the gases are still supposed to be dealt with in the same vast and balky negotiations that will reduce carbon dioxide so they will probably be on the table when diplomats gather in copenhagen in december to create a successor to the kyoto protocol of   but many environmental groups including the nonprofit environmental investigation agency say they would like to see the gases regulated using the montreal protocol because the framework succeeded in dealing with other pollutants the climate problem is not one global problem its a package of global problems said zaelke of the institute for governance and sustainable development you can reach in and pull out a piece sens john f kerry d mass and barbara boxer d calif who chair two powerful committees urged this approach in a letter to president obama in april last week an official said the administration was still deciding what approach to support a bigger question what will replace these chemicals experts say that some substitutes with less global warming impact can be made with new hfcs or by using ammonia or butane but others are needed we dont know all of them yet said mack mcfarland global environmental manager for dupont fluoroproducts a division of delaware based dupont
3,government schools common core indoctrinationsartre thecommon core site attempts to outline the purpose and worthiness of their education standards sounds like a noble goal however what is the reality as a natural outgrowth of meeting the charge to define college and career readiness the standards also lay out a vision of what it means to be a literate person in the twenty first century indeed the skills and understandings students are expected to demonstrate have wide applicability outside the classroom or workplace students who meet the standards readily undertake the close attentive reading that is at the heart of understanding and enjoying complex works of literature they habitually perform the critical reading necessary to pick carefully through the staggering amount of information available today in print and digitally they actively seek the wide deep and thoughtful engagement with high quality literary and informational texts that builds knowledge enlarges experience and broadens worldviews they reflexively demonstrate the cogent reasoning and use of evidence that is essential to both private deliberation and responsible citizenship in a democratic republic in short students who meet the standards develop the skills in reading writing speaking and listening that are the foundation for any creative and purposeful expression in language radical math boasts over   lesson plans articles charts books and websites that cover a wide range of socio political issues including redistribution of wealth discrimination against the poor by whites corporations banks etc and the message that widespread racism against blacks continues in the united states today now compare this critical appraisal to the lofty mission of math back in the common core mission statement how can this statement below square with the above practice for over a decade research studies of mathematics education in high performing countries have pointed to the conclusion that the mathematics curriculum in the united states must become substantially more focused and coherent in order to improve mathematics achievement in this country to deliver on the promise of common standards the standards must address the problem of a curriculum that is a mile wide and an inch deep these standards are a substantial answer to that challenge integration into a  st century business and social model is the ultimate intent of the common core objective nowhere is there a debate of what kind of future mankind wants or the kind of reality that all human beings are intrinsically part of those questions require the study in humanity education and liberal arts training that are quite different from the instruction in algorithm programming the worldview of this common core inculcation presupposes that society accepts their premises as a fait accompli their technocrat approach to instruction demands that authentic education must be marginalized if not outright eliminated the traditional christian cosmology has no place in this brave new world in the articlecommon cores negative impact on education and biblical literacy explains the destructive nature of this dehumanizing standardization the central organizing theme of the common core ela standards is that study of creative literature must be diminished in favor of nonfiction informational texts the idea is that students should be drilled in the types of documents they are more likely to encounter in their entry level jobs and make no mistake common core is a workforce development model not an education model the fundamental problem with the common core approach is that to achieve its job training goals it recognizes no difference between one complex text and another complex text a great work of literature has value far beyond the complexity of the words used it allows students to understand the eternal human condition it allows them to confront human challenges that recur throughout the ages it teaches empathy prudence forgiveness it transports the readers to places and times not their own the common core ela standards are quite simply indifferent to this type of education training not educating is their goal they are not interested in helping students become the people god created them to be they are interested in creating workers you can just hear the profane condemnation from theamerican federation of teacher and thenational education association opposing the mere mention of god in their secular temples of perdition irony excluded how biblical revelation dare be debated in a non judgmental culture of relativism at the heart of the government school establishment is an unending choir of fallen angels that preach their vision of paradise while demanding ever higher budgets and far greater control over the indoctrination of their impressionable guinea pigs one factor is the century long effort to nationalize and standardize american education the standardization efforts have their roots in dewey cubberley and the schools of education at stanford and columbia they picked up steam in the  s and  s as the national teachers unions gained more power they strengthened more when president jimmy carter fulfilled a promise to the nea by creating a separate cabinet level department of education the educrats dream of a day when every student in america will receive exactly the same education using the same textbooks and lesson plans those textbooks and lesson plans will of course be developed by the best and the brightest who will pass them down on tablets of stone the worker bees and drones will be programmed to follow them exactly this is a nightmare scenario one which anyone who believes in individual rights local control and federalism should oppose at every opportunity the common core standards become dangerous when they form a stepping stone which helps to move the educrats vision forward top down control always is intended to eradicate the voice of the individual under a national coordinated imposition of federal funding local school districts have become dependent upon the conditional requirements of conformity to keep the money flowing reform is no longer possible a federal department of education hastens central controls for social compliance at this point an education free from public schools has more value than going through the disinformation that is currently being taught the errors that are learned in childhood are more difficult to overturn then if they were never acquired in the first place so what exactly is the advantage in an education under government approved instructors if you want to reverse the decay in moral aptitude you must find alternatives for the education of your children common core pronouncements sound so nice in spite of this the key question is whether their program of study teaches the principles of developing good citizens lest we forget a good citizen is an independent thinking and rationally responsible trained advocate of liberty and moral values maintaining and expanding a structure of mindless and obedient state compliance is ridiculous

3,canada selling its soul to americastephen lendman contributor theyre also worried about a country junior partnering with imperial america israel and other rogue nato allies a previous article said the following on september   foreign minister john baird said canada closed its tehran embassy it expelled iranian diplomats in ottawa they have five days to leave he claimed a nonexistent iranian threat he took a page from aipacs playbook he bogusly called tehran the gravest threat to global security he accused iran of providing increasing military assistance to the assad regime he ignored washingtons war syria he said nothing about canadas role he didnt explain how america rogue nato partners and regional allies recruit arm fund train and direct ravaging death squads he was silent on what matters most he recited a litany of lies about iran he unconscionably pointed fingers the wrong way canada is a committed imperial partner its one of   nato countries it supports the worst of israels crimes its on the same slippery slope as america its fast tracking toward fascism sleeping with the devil rubs off unless stopped its just a matter of time before canada crosses a rubicon of no return its perilously close to full blown imperial neoliberalpolice state dark age harshness conservative and liberal parties allied with americas war on terrorism they stopped short of participating in its iraq coalition of the willing they willingly marched in lockstep with its illegal afghan war of aggression and occupation in february   they partnered with america and france against haitis jean bertrand aristide they ousted a democratically elected leader they crushed his popular movement they ended his progressive reforms they installed fascist harshness they had unchallenged pillaging in mind canada today operates as an appendage of imperial america it abandoned its traditional commitment to equality inclusiveness and rule of law inviolability its plagued by a militaristicimperialneoliberal culture its no longer a fair arbiter and promoter of just causes the conservative harper government is fast tracking toward fascism in the  s canadas downward trajectory began in earnest conservative prime minister brian mulroney bonded with ronald reagan corporate america remembers his december   address he appeared at the new york economic club business heavyweights packed the house to hear him he didnt disappoint he said canada was open for business his meaning was unambiguous us corporations were welcome economic integration would proceed americas sovereignty henceforth took precedence over canadas its been downhill ever since before stephen harper became prime minister in february   liberal leader paul martin tilted hard right in   he succeeded jean chrtien his   defense policy review stressed integrating canadas military with americas he approved redeploying canadian afghan peacekeepers as combatants harper maintains the same policy canadians have no say he governs in lockstep with washington he abandoned canadas traditional even handed israelpalestine agenda in   he threw its democratically elected hamas government under the bus doing so showed contempt for palestinian rights he showed no concern for    canadians in harms way during israels war of aggression on lebanon he called its death and destruction campaign measured post ww ii things were different canadas internationalism evolved it supported rule of law principles endorsed peacekeeping spurned militarism and imperialism and worked cooperatively with other nations no longer harpers government canadian elites its business community and military support imperialneoliberalanti populist policies ottawa replicates washington essential social programs are eroding egalitarianism is disappearing what corporate canada wants it gets militarism grows stronger so does police state harshness pandering to washington is policy tortured logic follows the same destructive path mcquaig calls harper americas unctuous little sidekick she compared canadas government corporate and military officials to  th century compradors modern day ones are subservient us junior partners canadas soul went on the auction block for sale like americans canadians are force fed the worst of all possible worlds ottawa allied with washingtons war on libya its partnered against syria and iran it shamelessly supports what it should renounce doing so makes it complicit in the supreme crime against peace its guilty of crimes of war against humanity and genocide its leaders are war criminals iran responded to canada suspending diplomatic ties foreign ministry spokesman ramin mehmanparast said the decision by canada showed that this country has sacrificed the interests of its nation for the sake of the zionists by following their policies against iran he called harpers government racist and hostile he added the closure of the visa section of the canadian embassy in tehran freezing the bank accounts of iranian nationals living in canada and prohibiting money transfers to iranian students studying in that country are among the canadian governments numerous hostile measures against the iranian nation and the iranian community in canada senior iranian lawmaker alaeddin boroujerdi accused harper of blindly following britain saying the british government certainly seeks to lead its friends to the same path that it had taken therefore this decision was in fact blind acquiescence by the canadian government he added that canada allied with washington and israels attempt to undermine a historic nam summit in tehran it perhaps reacted to its success he also called on irans foreign ministry to respond in kind mehmanparast said expect it to be swift britain is part of a usukisraeli troika its an axis of evil canada supports it it threatens humanity its involved in north africanmiddle eastcentral asian imperial wars it plans more independent nonbelligerent countries are targeted syrian and iranian sovereignty are threatened almost half a million iranians live in canada many reside in toronto tehran planned a consulate to serve them theyll have no representation now on friday netanyahu congratulated harper he called his move a bold decision a moral step a clear message to iran and to the entire world tehrans successful nam summit endorsed peace mutual cooperation irans peaceful nuclear program and national sovereignty netanyahu called it a show of anti semitism and hate in tehran every time he opens his mouth he puts his foot in it he displays racist scorn for muslims imperial brazenness contempt for anyone not jewish and hostile rage ottawa has had poor relations with iran since the   revolution they became strained after former canadian ambassador ken taylor helped rescue six americans during the   tehran hostage crisis in   they were further damaged after dual canadianiranian citizenfreelance photographer zahra kazemi died in custody he was arrested while taking photographs outside a tehran prison canada responded it recalled its ambassador iran ordered him out after unsuccessfully trying to resolve the issue and agree on exchanging ambassadors washington severed diplomatic relations in   in november   britain recalled its entire diplomatic staff it followed two days of protests hundreds of iranian students staged it outside londons tehran embassy they pulled down britains flag and demanded its envoys ouster without justification the cameron government claimed iranian leaders ordered it it also expelled its diplomats from london days earlier tehran downgraded ties to britain it was over londons decision to impose sanctions on irans central bank and false allegations about its nuclear program washington britain and israel target iran for regime change top priority ahead is war not now according to time magazine on september   it headlined worried about israel bombing iran before november you can relax saying according to some israeli analysts israels war of choice isnt cancelled its delayed internal opposition and public opinion are against it even defense minister ehud barak now wavers hes not called mr zigzag for nothing netanyahu wants washingtons full commitment in late september hell meet obama in new york theyll both address the un general assembly expect neither to sound benign netanyahus saber rattling bluster long ago wore thin but not his hostile intent he and obama remain on the same page differences are mostly over timing and perhaps strategy for now the us looks likely to persuade israel to sit on its hands nonetheless its probably a safe bet that war talk will be revved up again come spring or perhaps earlier post election canadian foreign minister baird didnt explain why he cut diplomatic ties now not earlier he denied perhaps knowing that war is more imminent than time imagines unequivocally we have no information about a military strike on iran he said in the fullness of time well know a final comment in   chicago tribune owner colonel robert mccormick called canadian statesmandiplomatlater prime minister    nobel peace prize laureate   lester pearson the most dangerous man in the english speaking world it was over pearsons refusal to cooperate with senator joe mccarthys witch hunt communist hearings they destroyed lives ruined careers accomplished nothing and led to mccarthys own demise pearsons ideas were mirror opposite harpers and other imperial aggressors he wanted nato involved with economic and social issues as well as defense he supported an alliance for western free market alternatives to communism he opposed nuclear weapons he challenged washington on policies he believed dangerous provocative and destructive in   as secretary of state for external affairs he was the first western official to visit moscow he spoke forcefully against colonial domination he endorsed sovereign rights for all nations he supported internationalism conciliation and peace he was a worthy nobel laureate his lecture stressed hard facts countries have a choice peace or extinction is in their hands he added that nations cannot be conditioned by the force and will of a unit however powerful but by the consensus of a group which must one day include all states predatory nations cant be tolerated he believed at the same time he opposed communism and backed efforts to contain it he erred supporting washingtons vietnam war a later temple university address challenged americas southeast asian role overall he supported peace and peacekeeping his nobel lecture named four faces of peace prosperity power diplomacy and people as prime minister peacekeeping was prioritized canada has none like him today neither do other western countries war not peace matters most so does imperial dominance ottawas on board with washington its traditions long ago eroded and died some wonder what

3,the deep stateby doug casey im here to tell you that the inevitable became reality in   weve had an interlude over the last few years financed by trillions of new currency units however the economic clock on the wall is reading the same time as it was in   and the black horsemen of your worst financial nightmares are about to again crash through the doors and end the party and this time they wont be riding childrens ponies but armored percherons to refresh your memory let me recount what a depression is the best general definition is a period of time when most peoples standard of living drops significantly by that definition the greater depression started in   although historians may someday say it began in   when real wages started falling its also a period of time when distortions and misallocations of capital are liquidated and when the business cycle which is caused exclusively by currency debasement also known as inflation climaxes that results in high unemployment business failures uncompleted construction bond defaults stock market crashes and the like fortunately for those who benefit from the status quo and members of something called the deep state the trillions of new currency units delayed the liquidation but they also ensured it will now happen on a much grander scale the deep state is an extremely powerful network that controls nearly everything around you you wont read about it in the news because it controls the news politicians wont talk about it publicly that would be like a mobster discussing murder and robbery on the   oclock news you could say the deep state is hidden but its only hidden in plain sight the deep state is the source of every negative thing thats happening right now to survive the coming rough times its essential for you to know what its all about now what causes economic problems with the exception of natural events like fires floods and earthquakes theyre all caused directly and indirectly by the state through its wars taxes regulations and inflation yes yes i know this is an oversimplification that human nature is really at fault and the institution of the state is only a mass dramatization of the psychological aberrations and demons that lie within us all but we dont have time to go all the way down the rabbit hole so lets just talk about the proximate rather than the ultimate causes of the greater depression and here i want to talk about the nature of the state in general and then something called the deep state in particular a key takeaway and i emphasize that because i expect it to otherwise bounce off the programmed psyches of most people is that the very idea of the state itself is poisonous evil and intrinsically destructive but like so many bad ideas people have come to assume its part of the cosmic firmament when its really just a monstrous scam its a fraud like your belief that you have a right to free speech because of the first amendment or a right to be armed because of the second amendment no you dont the us constitution is just an arbitrary piece of paperentirely apart from the fact the whole thing is now just a dead letter you have a right to free speech and to be armed because theyre necessary parts of being a free person not because of what a political document says even though the essence of the state is coercion people have been taught to love and respect it most people think of the state in the quaint light of a grade school civics book they think it has something to do with we the people electing a jimmy stewart character to represent them that ideal has always been a pernicious fiction because it idealizes sanitizes and legitimizes an intrinsically evil and destructive institution which is based on force as mao once said political power comes out of the barrel of a gun but things have gone far beyond that were now in the deep state the concept of the deep state originated in turkey which is appropriate since its the heir to the totally corrupt byzantine and ottoman empires and in the best byzantine manner the deep state has insinuated itself throughout the fabric of what once was america its tendrils reach from washington down to every part of civil society like a metastasized cancer it can no longer be easily eradicated i used to joke that there was nothing wrong with washington that   megatons on the capital couldnt cure but i dont say that anymore partially because its too dangerous but mainly because its now untrue whats now needed is   megatons on the capital and four more bursts in a quadrant   miles out in many ways washington models itself after another city with a deep state ancient rome heres how a victorian freethinker winwood reade accurately described it rome lived upon its principal till ruin stared it in the face industry is the only true source of wealth and there was no industry in rome by day the ostia road was crowded with carts and muleteers carrying to the great city the silks and spices of the east the marble of asia minor the timber of the atlas the grain of africa and egypt and the carts brought out nothing but loads of dung that was their return cargo the deep state controls the political and economic essence of the us this is much more than observing that theres no real difference between the left and right wings of the demopublican party its well known by anyone with any sense that is by everybody except the average voter that although the republicans say they believe in economic freedom but dont they definitely dont believe in social freedom and the democrats say they believe in social freedom but dont but they definitely dont believe in economic freedom the american deep state is a real but informal structure that has arisen to not just profit from but control the state the deep state has a life of its own like the government itself its composed of top echelon employees of a dozen praetorian agencies like the fbi cia and nsatop generals admirals and other military operativeslong term congressmen and senatorsand directors of important regulatory agencies but deep state is much broader than just the government it includes the heads of major corporations all of whom are heavily involved in selling to the state and enabling it that absolutely includes silicon valley although those guys at least have a sense of humor evidenced by their dont be evil motto it also includes all the top people in the fed and the heads of all the major banks brokers and insurers add the presidents and many professors at top universities which act as deep state recruiting centersall the top media figures of courseand many regulars at things like bohemian grove and the council on foreign relations they epitomize the status quo held together by power money and propaganda altogether ill guess these people number a thousand or so you might analogize the structure of the deep state with a huge pack of dogs the people ive just described are the top dogs but there are hundreds of thousands more who arent at the nexus but who directly depend on them have considerable clout and support the deep state because it supports them this includes many of the wealthy especially those who got that way thanks to their state connectionsthe    million people who have top secret clearances thats a shocking but accurate number plus top players in organized crime especially the illegal drug business little of which would exist without the state plus mid level types in the police and military corporations and non governmental organizations these are what you might call the running dogs beyond that are the scores and scores of millions who depend on things remaining the way they are like the   plus of americans who are net recipients of benefits from the statethe   million on social securitythe   million on medicaidthe   million on food stampsthe many millions on hundreds of other programs the   million government employees and most of their families in fact lets include the many millions of average joes and janes who are just getting by you might call this level of people the vast majority of the population whipped dogs they both love and fear their master theyll do as theyre told and theyll roll over on their backs and wet themselves if confronted by a top dog or running dog who feels theyre out of line these three types of dogs make up the vast majority of the us population i trust you arent among them i consider myself a lone wolf in this context and hope you are too unfortunately however dogs are enemies of wolves and tend to hunt them down the deep state is destructive but its great for the people in it and like any living organism its prime directive is survive it survives by indoctrinating the fiction that its both good and necessary however its a parasite that promotes the ridiculous notion that everyone can live at the expense of society is it a conspiracy headed by a man stroking a white cat i think not i find its hard enough to get a bunch of friends to agree on what movie to see much less a bunch of power hungry miscreants bent on running everyones lives but on the other hand the top dogs all know each other went to the same schools belong to the same clubs socialize and most important have common interests values and philosophies the american deep state rotates around the washington beltway it imports americas wealth as tax revenue a lot of that wealth is consumed there by useless mouths and then it exports things that reinforce the deep state including wars fiat currency and destructive policies this is unsustainable simply because nothing of value comes out of the city editors note doug casey literally wrote the book on profiting during an economic crisis and if his predictions about the coming crisis are true you wont want to miss out in his latest bookgoing global   doug reveals the best way to survive a currency collapse how to legally make some of your money invisible to the us governmentand which asset could soar in value during the next currency crisis normally this get it done manual retails for   but we believe its so important for you to act now to protect yourself and

4,los angeles   the room is dark and crowded heavy with the scent of cigarettes and sweat  as an ancient fan strains against the thick air an array of tough looking guys in biker gear belly up to a rickety table  tattooed bearded and unwashed looking  they share the bonds of bad attitude and rebellion cradling burgundy beverages before getting down to the discussion at hand gene hackman and al pacinos finest movie scarecrow might be hackmans best work and he always does great work insists ron perlman   foot plus with a spider tattoo  to nods of agreement  its a clinic on acting offers another voice  like watching hells angels discuss a fine chardonnay its an incongruous scene as this group dissects the   road movie pairing method actor pacino with in the moment master hackman two soon to be legends setting the bar high  then the camera swings into place another voice yells action and perlman who some might recognize as the title character from guillermo del toros freaky hellboy movies starts grumbling about getting in on a big illegal gun purchase thats life on the set of fxs sons of anarchy a kinetic drama about an outlaw biker club where art and a particularly grungy subculture meet in a surprisingly popular and profitable marriage the show returns for its third season tonight as the club reels from a series of setbacks the murder of a prospective member the kidnapping of a leaders infant son and the polices pursuit of club matriarch gemma morrow for two murders including a woman who helped maneuver her into a brutal gang rape last season its a potent mix of story lines arching from canada to ireland detailing conflicts reaching back generations its also a tale that makes heroes of characters we usually see as buffoons or villains exhibit a in how far modern television will go to make us root for compelling antiheroes weve never seen before no one may be more surprised than star perlman who couldnt even ride a motorcycle when he started performing in the show as outlaw gang leader clarence clay morrow two seasons ago even though im not putting on any makeup or transforming myself in any outwardly physical way its probably the biggest jump ive ever had to make  said perlman best known before sons for donning loads of latex to play charismatic monsters such as the beast in cbss beauty and the beast series and hellboy my movements have never taken me inside that world and now were forced to explore it he added they have a very strong moral compass even though they live outside of conventional law they seem to be fighting for something that they truly believe is right not only for themselves but for the ones that they love thats a compelling thing to watch standing in the unassuming tangle of offices and sets that form the shows north hollywood headquarters its obvious the actors and production crew share a bit of their characters outsider spirit criminally unrecognized by the emmy awards co star katey sagal offered a career high performance last season as morrows wife gemma struggling to cope with the rapes aftermath the sons crew band together like the bikers they portray but sagal shrugs off the slight by noting that fans dont seem to share emmys disinterest my favorite was this guy who came up with a picture of a sons of anarchy t shirt his mom had made    standing with his platoon in afghanistan all of them wearing the t shirt said sagal wife of series creator kurt sutter thats the true reward for us as actors passionate for sons you still hear traces of his native newcastle england in the words but   year old sons star charlie hunnam an actor so passionate he rarely drops out of character during close ups has a simple question while rehearsing a scene with sagal perlman and the rest of the gang whats really going on here forget the snide jokes about an actor seeking motivation in this rehearsal on the sons cramped production stage hunnams query kicks off an earnest discussion that leads sagal to figure out shes wearing the wrong costume saving them all from wasted time on unusable footage re creating the world of small town bikers is serious business for the sons crew who value the way real life mcs motorcycle clubs have embraced their scrappy enterprise small wonder to help viewers love the sons sutter has given them even worse enemies a neo nazi rapist played by punk poet henry rollins and a sense of clubfamily loyalty that forms the only rules these outlaws wont break its so rarely explored that when the biker world is explored it can be very one dimensional said perlman we were most trepidatious about how it would be received would they think we were being exploitive or gratuitous and weve gotten overwhelming support everywhere i go they find im in town im invited to the club but outside its passionate fan base sons of anarchy may be the quietest hit on television record hit for fx amcs mad men may get more magazine covers but sons is the biggest hit fx has ever had drawing nearly   million people each week over its multiple airings last season the shows audience grew   percent last year from its first season drawing an average    million viewers in its second season twice the eyeballs for a typical mad men episode now sons starts its third season with an ambitious story line revealing the history of the motorcycle club as hunnams jackson jax teller chases an irish gun running terrorist who stole his infant son to be fair the guy thought tellers mom sagals gemma morrow killed his son initially demoralized by his sons kidnapping jax toughens up to chase his son across the globe as gemma lams it from the cops providing a crash course on the clubs history scattered across three continents sutter already has fretted about meeting last years explosive success even though sons has everything from an upcoming iphone app to a spot on a nascar racer to promote its return and with a higher profile has come controversy including a   million lawsuit from biker actor chuck zito alleging sons was ripped off from his ideas and a passionately profane rebuttal on sutters personal blog in which he called zito a half talent looking for a payday to me the growth of sons of anarchy between season one and season two was an extraordinary anomaly sutter wrote on his blog it was a result of the shows season one premiere getting sideswiped by the rnc palin speech and the steady increase of fans we added as season one continued unfortunately this season anything less than another huge increase will most likely be labeled a failure sagal whose real life fierce mom attitude led sutter to create the gemma character is just trying to enjoy work with venerated actor hal holbrook who plays gemmas estranged dementia inflicted dad while negotiating a shakespearean drama set on two wheels this season we open the world into this bigger area she added in words that could describe the shows own real life growing pains youll see how they are awed by the largeness of a violent world maybe in comparison where they have lived is not quite that eric deggans can be reached at degganssptimescom or       see the feed blog at

3,the future of socialized healthcare there is no better predictor than the va systemmac slavo perhaps armageddon hasnt arrived for those who have been allowed to keep their platinum health insurance because of exemptions granted by the administration but for the rest of us a healthcare armageddon is a foregone conclusion economically and financially the new law will bankrupt an already struggling middle class who has in many cases seen a four fold increase in their monthly premiums by all accounts life for those people is going to change dramatically in coming years because as much as   of their income will now be taken from them by force in the form of what the us supreme court has classified as a mandated tax for those with the ability to make those outrageous payments and deductibles each year they have now entered a system run by the very same bureaucrats in charge of our countrys other government run health care programs to understand the future of socialized health care in america we need to look no further than the us department of veterans affairs you could ask the scores of veterans who were pencil pushed to the back of the line by the va in phoenix and houston except for the fact that they died while awaiting the medical assistance they were promised and while the deaths of these service members is tragic and almost unbelievable it is just the tip of the iceberg tens of thousands of our veterans are shuffled around within the system often times for budgetary reasons or because their physician is just is simply too apathetic to care if you need real medical care for example which often starts with a diagnosis that may include testing like an x ray or an mri its common for va physicians to simply ignore the patients need and jump right into prescribing pain medication there are countless stories like this where patients literally waited years to receive a real diagnosis only to see their condition worsen and become inoperable by the time testing was completed because it was ignored for so long that very system which has ignored those men and women who have put their lives on the line for this country and has promised to care for them is now the same system thats in charge of medical care under the patient affordable care act in fact if recent history is any guide the mandates under obamacare are going to be much much worse the death panels may not exist by name but they most assuredly exist within the bureaucracy managed by the us government were not making this up its no conspiracy and it cannot be debunked as evidenced by the experiences of actual people currently enrolled in the obamacare system in simple terms if you get cancer you will not get medical care this is by every possible definition nothing short of a death panel with the patient affordable care act we have no other choice but the health insurance prescribed by the government and cancer treatment is not covered according to the hospitals that are supposed to provide it just wait until you see what happens when these bureaucrats realize that the medical system is underfunded because healthy people especially young adults refuse to sign up you see obamacare is in essence a ponzi scheme that requires one group to continually provide funding in order to pay off the needs of another group despite that claimed number of    million americans having signed up since the programs inception a recent report indicates that as many as half of the enrollees missed their first insurance paymentone reason for this might be the exorbitant costs associated with the coverage not counting the deductibles as these liabilities begin to pile up and not enough people sign up to make up the difference guess what happens again in simple terms an instantaneous collapse of obamacare services while the law may never be repealed and everybody who signed up thinks they still have health insurance when it matters most there wont be a doctor on the list wholl be willing to help you thats what we can call a de facto death panel they had them back in the old communist days of the east bloc it wasnt by name of course but rather by action people used to stand in hours long lines just to be seen for an ear infection or to receive antibiotics unless of course you could throw the doc a little summin summin under the table then you were prioritized eastern europeans and soviet russians who lived under the red banner prior to   will tell you you dont go to the hospital to live longer you go there to die this is the same system we now have in place in america despite the fact that ear wax eating congressman joe garcia claimed just this week that democrats have proven communism works it works great for people like the congressman who suck off the taxpayer teat enjoy free platinum health care coverage and dine at premier ear wax eateries around dc for the rest of us however communism works about as well as it did for the millions of slaves who eventually tore down the berlin wall to escape its stranglehold you can read more from mac slavo at his site shtfplancom where this first appeared

3,the tsas answer to long lines is wait for it more securityby mac slavo problem reaction solution though the tsa has never been effective at catching or reducing terrorism it has become very good at inconveniencing americans rifling through their things herding them through s ray machines reminiscent of nazi policies forcing people to withstand increasingly long lines with many people even losing out on flights all in the name of security after wait times across the country have made headlines and left airport travelers stranded and fed up homeland security chief jeh johnson whose agency overseas the transportation security administration tsa is calling for a solution based in what else greater security secretary johnson is using the   travel crisis to push for more sign ups in its pre check program in which applicants undergo a rigorous background check and pay an   fee for speedy tsa screenings johnson dubbed it the e zpass of airports as cbs news reports as the tsa struggles to fix the airport security gridlock airlines are jumping in to help johnson told cbs this morning that becoming a tsa precheck member would help cut the wait down to an average of five minutes or less  but johnson said that even in the face of increased travel volume we are not going to compromise aviation security anything to avoid a long line and a pat down eh johnsons comments gave a strong indication that the controversial agency had no plans of backing down despite long lines vowing not to compromise on security in other words those not willing to sign up for the additional background check program will be left waiting for now this pre check system is an elite path to bypassing the rigor and discomfort of tsa screenings and speed up the hassle of traveling in the long run it is part of the biometric id grid that will place everyone under preemptive suspicion and real time global surveillance and monitoring those who seek greater control are using the problem of long airport lines to whip the public into compliance with its new security systems which have been active for many years but so far only adopted by a few if people dont sign up now can they expect more terrorism

in database system w fingerprints and pay them too again no i predicted the pressure for pre check scenario two weeks ago after the you caught that too old souls think alike its a never ending series of problem reaction solution tptb are able to spin virtually any story and any incidents to serve their ends ive found seeing it is akin to deciphering a puzzle or code once recognized the illusions disappear allegorically i picture the image of cypher in the matrix staring at a green screen of symbols cascading down and he says i dont even see the code anymore hello blue yes that scene perfectly describes it good pick im definitely seeing the matrix crashing today obama said people need to prep for disasters when less than a year ago he was calling preppers alarmists domestic terrorists and fruit loops glitch did you happen to see the video of the swiss tunnel ceremony ritual truly bizarre i dont want to post a link because it takes days to get approved i saw it on huffington post this am im sure its all over the interwebs by now no i missed it os thanks for the tip i found a collection of pics on bbc bacchanalian wow theater of the absurd at its apogee with european style brain orgies the woman with a bird outfit flying over the men playing the dead construction workers oh no scarred for life as disturbing as the bohemian grove cremation of care ceremony performed in robes in front of the giant moloch good catch on the disaster comment yep always playing both sides of any issue obama as puppet is also doing a reversal on the deliberate policy of social security payments steadily losing ground to inflation saying there should be big cost of living increases goes hand in hand with the elite push for a big increase in the minimum wage and the testing and floating of the basic income aka minimum income paradigm ties into negative interests rates too and more it has to do with the plan for global currency debasement the race to the bottom redistribution and money printing hyperinflation magnified in the us with an eventual transitioning out of the dollar reserve system interesting times is that why we volunteered lol whoa totally missed all that on social securitybasic income thanks for bringing that to my attention our four eyes are better than two yes this is why we volunteered i am loving every minute of mr toads wild ride i just woke up a sleeper today showed her the video of the tunnel ceremony and she said that looks satanic this person is a dear friend but shes totally immersed in mainstream everything for her to see this on her own without prompting is amazing eyes wide open so about this minimum income deal what are we looking at here global socialism give everyone a basic subsistence income with a few zillion conditions attached is this from agenda   i guess i dont know where this is all coming from or where its going can you help this poor little alice yep a zillion strings attached absolute control chinese style and progressing further it is related to agenda   but on the macroeconomic front its more of a reflection of agenda   thanks for that i tend to avoid most financial stuff these days despite a career as a commodity trader back in the stones ages but ive pretty much avoided all this on purpose probably because i sense there are many pockets of not  d areas forming up around the planet people coming together and forming something else to replace tptb with the power of us sometimes i think these agendas with future numbers are just another boring mind game i dont know but i do know that i saw a raven flying upside down today right in front of me i have seen eagle aerobatics many times but never a bird flying along ten feet over the earth upside down i applauded he tipped his wing and then executed a perfect barrel role in spite of all of the global weirdness right beside it is global awakeness i feel positive energy growing and the signs are everywhere if we look for them did you see elon musk and his ai interview about the matrix what a hoot youre very welcome oldesoul commodities trader very cool i imagine you have a good math brain and would be someone i could share macroeconomic concepts with and you could keep up with the synthesis i probably should have provided a little more perspective on the basic income deal which is being floated launched and tested around the world in various ways mostly pilot programs as you no doubt already surmised the rolling of bi along with other indicators signifies the birth of technofeudal marxism on a global scale its the final resource power grab by the global elite its beginning as a whirlwind now in the developed oil wealthy gulf states in the form of austerity austerity and strict rationing being a strong feature of the new   era huge pension funds in the us have been going bust it isnt a coincidence expect redistribution and debasement helicopter benbeyond qe the agenda edicts are real pervasive insidious and built into the transforming infrastructure the veil is falling though simply because they cant hide it any longer heres to the power of us to change the dynamic as for watching birds i cant get enough of them myself they always amaze me the raptors are my favorite majestic powerful but i love them all and wish i knew more about them even their nests are super cool having watched a pbs online nature show on birds nests a few months ago no i didnt take the time to preview the elon musk interview ill check it out thanks okay wait technofeudal marxism i really havent been paying attention even the term is hard to wrap my head around a lot of people very focused on the financial collapse just as there are a lot of others focused on creating what will take the place of the financial world once it comes down it can go either their way or our way and its not a given that it will go their way not at all thats what we volunteered for the spiritual aspects of the awakening hold the keys not the gold and silver traders and the helicopter bens funny and the irrational exuberance greenspans those power structures are falling along along with the matrix just like vaccines and the twin towers i see that clear as day what happens to all their power when they crash the financial system they are not infallible not even close because greed and power lust cannot sustain indefinitely on a planet ascending to  d they are repeating the exact same scenario that brought down atlantis and thats a lot more likely than agenda whatever plus now that were on to the fact they use our collective consciousness to program the matrix we can simply stop doing it our minds create what we believe so they tell us what to believe and we do it not any more and guess what the birds hold the answers keep watching and listening because they are speaking loud and clear did we ever talk about me working for a raptor rehab agency we have owls hawks and eagles mostly although i have a very close relationship with raven and hes never steered me wrong before the dude does barrel rolls like nobodys business we shouldnt have to pay them anything the entire ruse is based on the    false flag attack the body scanner based on another false flag with the underwear bomber caught in the act by attorney and whistleblower kurt haskell why are we standing in line like sheep stripping down and getting irradiated its insanityconformist mind controlproverbial lemmings you kiddies go stand around in your undies and the gentle tsa will insert the cattle prod it does not need any help from the tsa to sink america because it is on its way down already you pay thousands of dollars for an airline ticket for a vacation plus deposits for hotels rental cars and activities only to lose most of that money and start your vacation angry so some tsa drone can fondle your undies i cant believe people will stand in lines and wait patiently to be treated like cattle entering an abattoir but of course if you pay them more money and offer up all the details of your life you can avoid everything except the blackmail and extortion why the h would anyone want to fly business people have a pass or star id that bypasses security checks i have been told by someone who is a frequent flyer there are other ways to travel let the airlines go busted imo i dont think it is the safest way to travel anymore either we will see more aircraft falling out of the sky over time blamed on terrorists in the end no one will travel to overseas destination and i think thats what they want take yer shoies off widdle kiddies wonder why the underwear bomber didnt force everyone to stand around in their skin i totally agree with you on the concept of conditioned austerity especially as people now seem to spend the majority of their incomes on all the insurance scams myriad forms of taxation debt interest and medical care not covered by insurance that leaves just enough for popcorn and a predictive programming movie once a year they have already secured most of the resources both on this planet and the others they have already plundered but is it conditioned austerity or a free will choice to return to what is meaningful its interesting when you take steps to live off the land and do with less how much nicer and simpler life becomes you choose different priorities a new chicken coop instead of a new swimming pool a new tractor instead of a new boat etc i know im simplifying this complex topic although ive made both of those choices myself already ha but living quietly and simply can be very satisfying rewarding and healthful for your mind and body the global technocracy sort of just disappears over the horizon when you find a little pocket of serenity somewhere plant tomatoes and soak up nature instead of their soulless version of tech fashion and popular culture just throwing away the tv has amazing consequences all of them good be the change you wish to see yep im a scratched and broken lp for sure all i know is that creating the breathing room in life to be able to go for a bike ride on country roads and see a raven flying upside down beats anything the cabal has ever dreamed of they cannot prevail because they are so incredibly boring in a universe that literally exists on creative imagination and soul filled experiences they can have their soulless worlds and power trips but they cant have it all because there are   billion of us still holding this planet down and only about ten of them and theyre scared sheetless about the day that  th monkey takes the stage im totally with you on the great pleasures of simplicity and minimalism escaping the hamster wheels and all the trappings theres nothing even close to nature hiking biking and authentic connections its not the austerity as in hitting the ejector button on materialism that concerns me its how it is being wielded as a tool did you see where europe is now trying to do the chinarussia bit of issuing id numbers to track social media and internet use on an individual basis btw im still traumatized by that tunnel ceremony lol happy birding os yes i sense that hitting the ejector button on materialism gig too first you must consume and then they tell us we are bad little humans for consuming too much its just more of their never ending pile of inconsistent bs they are having trouble keeping all their lies tied together sneaky little truths keep leaking out and some people are really adept at connecting those dots ya the tunnel ceremony got weirder the more you looked at it there are quite a few videos of different parts of it some they did inside some outside all weird it reminded me of the scene in eyes wide shut the way the spectators to the ritual were perfectly still and showed no emotion it was meant to be troubling just like everything else they eject into the quantum field it feels like the dying gasp of an old paradigm like whenever a king dies his countrys entire timeline shifts in an instant because he powered the energy field im still wondering why they are so fascinated with goats even so i feel nothing but optimism strange as that sounds the weirder they get the more fallible they become

3,by unilaterally changing obamacare obama is making a mockery of the constitutionmichael snyder and as stanford law school professor michael mcconnell wrote back in july the office of legal counsel for the justice department has always insisted that the president has no authority as one such memo put it in   to refuse to enforce a statute he opposes for policy reasons this is an open and shut case if the us congress still had a shred of respect for the constitution they would immediately demand that obama enforce the law as written if obama refused they should immediately impeach him we are a country that is run by the rule of law and just because obamas new law completely screws up one sixth of the economy does not mean that he can unilaterally change it in our system congress makes the laws and the president enforces them if we allow any president to unilaterally change laws whenever he does not like them then that puts us dangerously close to having a dictator in the white house yes obamacare is an absolute nightmare of a law yes people should be allowed to keep their current health insurance plans and obama should actually be trying to keep his original promise by encouraging congress to allow people to keep their current health insurance plans permanently he simply does not possess the power to unilaterally change a law by himself does the constitution matter in america anymore apparently not and what obama is trying to do is not likely to save many health insurance policies anyway marc thiessen recently explained why this is the case for three years at obamas direction insurers and state regulators have been planning to cancel millions of individual market plans and move those people into the obamacare exchanges at the end of this year that process cannot be easily reversed six weeks before the transfer was to take place insurers did not negotiate prices with doctors and hospitals or put plans through the state regulatory process there is no magic wand the president can wave to suddenly reinstate canceled plans if obamas fix fails a humanitarian disaster will ensue come jan   millions of americans could find themselves without the health coverage obama promised they could keep suddenly the horror stories we are hearing today of people getting cancellation letters will be replaced by horror stories of cancer patients having their treatment disrupted and sick children being cut off from their doctors and hospitals the outrage americans are expressing today will pale by comparison to the outrage that will ensue when people who had insurance before obamacare cant get medical care they are accustomed to because they lost their plans obama cannot force insurance companies to go back and sell the old insurance policies to customers that they have already canceled and he certainly cannot force state insurance regulators to accept those old plans for example the states of washington and arkansas have already announced that they will not be allowing insurance companies to extend their old health insurance plans other states may soon follow and as richard a epstein recently noted many health insurance company executives are absolutely outraged that obama has now given them a task which will be nearly impossible to accomplish on time a major new disclosure program will need to be built from scratch over the christmas holidays on top of a reinstatement process that has to overcome huge hurdles within individual companies who have to reprice their revised policies before gaining regulatory approval on a state by state basis no wonder their executives are up in arms but even if by some miracle obamas fix is implemented successfully there is still the matter that this is completely and totally unconstitutional the following is how us senator rand paul expressed his concerns the other day obamacare is not fixable and the presidents administrative attempts to fix it are unconstitutional sen rand paul r ky told fox news on monday one of the clear separations of powers was that the legislature was supposed to legislate and the president wasnt hes essentially amended obamacare maybe    some odd times and i dont think hes allowed to and so i think it needs to be decided in court paul said yes this most definitely needs to go to court but will it probably not once again the us congress is going to stand by and watch a president trample all over the constitution and do nothing about it meanwhile the reality of how horrible obamacare is turning out to be continues to sink in for example a   year old single mother that obama specifically singled out as an obamacare success story is now discovering that she cant afford her new health insurance policy after all the cnn report quotes president obama as saying i recently received a letter from a woman named jessica sanford in washington state and heres what she wrote i am a single mom no child support self employed and i havent had insurance for   years because its too expensive i was crying the other day when i signed up so much stress lifted but days just really three days after she was mentioned by the president jessica sanford started having problems she was receiving letters from the washington state health exchange reports cnn the first letter telling her that tax credit was reduced therefore increasing the cost of her health care plan and the take a look at this then she received a letter just last week telling her that her tax credit had been taken away all together show you another document here showing what the tax credit worked out to be zero dollars according to this document that was provided to us by jessica sanford she describes all of this as a roller coaster ride now she says she cant afford insurance in washington state because of the new developments so what do you think of obamacare so far and what do you think of the fact that obama is blatantly trampling all over the constitution

1,middle east policy has reached an inflexion point a moment when official washington seems to be caught in the middle between escalation and retreat   on one hand the rhetoric has not been more militant since hillary clintons famous we came we saw he died moment in october   with barack obama halfway out the door and clinton all but crowned washingtons laptop bombardiers are rejoicing that the half measures are over and judgment day nearly at hand samantha power permanent representative of the united states to the un addresses the security council meeting on syria sept     power has been an advocate for escalating us military involvement in syria un photo   thus the new york times assures us that that the middle east is desperate for american leadership while the washington post reports that the republicans and democrats who make up the foreign policy elite are laying the ground work for a more assertive american foreign policy   leading think tanks are publishing a flurry of reports urging stepped up intervention including us backed safe zones to protect moderate rebels from syrian and russian forces and even limited cruise missile strikes but while differing on the details all agree something must be done the time to act is now   as vox puts it the hot new policy idea in washington is the hottest old idea direct us military intervention in syrias civil war   but reading between the lines a very different picture emerges a realization that the us has painted itself into a corner and that there is little it can do after all thus the times observes that while the middle east is clamoring for us leadership it is not clamoring for bush style intervention but for some mythical middle ground in between him and obama   while reporting that pro escalation sentiment is unanimous in washingtons vast foreign policy establishment  sometimes known as  the blob   the washington post notes that even pinprick cruise missile strikes designed to hobble the syrian air force or punish president bashar al assad would risk a direct confrontation with russian forces and wonders whether a war weary public will support any intervention at all   my concern is that we may be talking to each other and agreeing with each other it quotes one expert as saying but that these discussions are isolated from where the public may be right now   official washington in a bubble   thus even the establishment worries that it lives in a bubble washington wants war it needs war and yet it admits in practically the same breath that it cant have it

1,in a new interview with britains sky news former nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen brought out the old narrative of america as the worlds policeman but with a lot more upbeat of an attitude about it than one would generally see  rasmussen criticized president obama for not being hawkish enough saying his successor needs to be much more interventionist and declaring  we need america as the worlds policeman  adding that the us needs to restore international law and order through wars  rasmussen who was always a relative hawk in the post but seems to have taken it to an entirely new level set out a series of things the us needs to fix militarily including iraq syria libya russia china and north korea this of course closely mirrors recent pentagon talk of wars in the decades to come  the timing of his calls for extreme us bellicosity are centered on trying to influence the upcoming us election in favor of democratic nominee hillary clinton who has campaigned heavily on picking fights in syria and against russia rasmussen underscored this fact by declaring donald trump who openly said the us cannot be the worlds police as very dangerous for the world
3,us citizen no foreign bank account for youjeff berwick sadly thanks to the upcoming foreign account tax compliance act fatca in the us banks around the world are turning away us passport holders no bank account for you but you dont even have to do anything wrong other than having been born a us citizen decades ago holding a us passport was a ticket to worldwide opportunity today it is nearly the opposite first it started with the erosion of the uss reputation as a bastion of freedom then legislation after legislation made it nearly impossible to do business with us persons as the nation became increasingly paranoid and fixated with raising funds faced with draconian penalties on foreign banks who accept us citizens countless banks worldwide are deciding it is easier and safer to just turn away all us customer business not to mention much cheaper no investments or brokerages for you either this has been the case for a long time in regards to investments and brokerages the sec has made it clear to anyone worldwide that if you even offer investment opportunities to us citizens they will come after you with the full power of the us government the reason they say is to protect the fragile and gullible american citizens from losing money in foreign investment opportunities what it really does is limits the investment options of americans dramatically at a time when the us economy is tanking and other economies around the world have been booming banks rapidly shutting down us clients with thousands of banks in the world it is impossible to keep track of the changes taking place but it will probably become a rule of thumb that international banks simply do not accept us clients in fact most banks we deal with at tdvoffshore do not accept us clients most information we receive just comes from us passport holders who have recently had their accounts closed down or were denied application the future is clear banks are no longer accepting americans because of fatca from europe to asia to the caribbean the same is true the decision is simple for banking institutions in fact it is merely an issue of the bottom line it is not worth it to track and report the data they are now required to under fatca bobby casey a good friend of tdv who deals with international banks all the time recounted recent experiences he has been having meeting with bank representatives i asked if there were any changes to the banks policy on accepting american clients the answer was yes they no longer accept americans as of march  st   the reason fatca we have another caribbean bank we work with that has as of february  st stopped accepting american clients just this week one of my business partners walked into a local bank in latvia to open an account and they rejected him why he is american over leveraged us banks by hemming in americans to keeping their money in us banks it creates a number of serious risks to their capital the us banking system is leveraged at   to   which means that an   drop in asset values will destroy all us equity its worse elsewhere japans banks are leveraged at   to   frances are   to   germany is   to   but the uss own federal reserve is by far the most over leveraged at   to   that means the federal reserve which has bailed out the world to the tune of trillions of dollars is more over leveraged than many of the institutions it is supposed to help that is twice as over leveraged as the european union banking system which as you may remember housed the cyprus banks which ultimately collapsed it is no wonder why they want to keep all their money domestically all the easier bail in when the time comes either that or they will have to print a torrent of more money to keep the system alive leading to hyperinflation and destruction of the dollar fatca goes global at the same time many nation states all over the world are drafting legislation to put them on par with us post fatca to comfortably bank anywhere in the world is steadily becoming a thing of the past yesterday we reported governments worldwide adopting fatca style legislation that russia has introduced its own fatca style legislation it is all a nefarious form of capital controls that is descending on many countries throughout the world rather than tell you that you cant take your money out of the country straight up capital controls they just pressure banks around the world to not accept your citizens as clients or to report all transactions back to them like an unpaid tax collector which most banks do not want to go through the trouble to do for this reason we have again set up an urgent conference the tdv wealth management crisis conference in cabo san lucas from april  th may  th there are still ways to internationalize your funds and protect them from the prying eyes and outstretched claws of your government but it is not looking good in the near future as governments around the world continue to implode under record breaking amounts of debt they will continue to take their own citizens wealth at ever increasing levels there are still legal and viable options to protect yourself from that as i have personally done nearly a decade ago but if you still havent begun to prepare id be running not walking to do so when it comes to your and your familys hard earned wealth it is always better a

3,the truth about red tides manmade causes and health effectssayer ji contributor the reality is that authorities who deny the involvement of land based activities and algae blooms are conveniently ignoring the science which is peer reviewed and published that instructs us on what is feeding red tide near shore florida has only so many industries that sustain its fragile economy many of which would have to enact substantial and costly reforms in order to improve the environmental situation the tourism and real estate industries also have a vested interest in minimizing andor denying the extent of the problem at least in the short term the long term outlook however is dismal for these industries who failing to act would see the primary attractor for tourists or potential buyers of real estate the gulf of mexico transformed into a petri dish it is for this reason that the truth about red tide must gain a wider audience and we hope widespread acceptance since late september last year the southwest florida gulf coast has been under siege by laboratory verified blooms see status maps growing to its present state of significant outbreaks of a million cells per liter or higher and stretching all the way from manatee county to the florida keys this is one of the worst red tide outbreaks in recorded historyi these figures however are quite misleading using colloquial expressions such as very low to describe concentrations of karenia brevis of    to    cells per liter does the public a disservice as they are serious enough to lead to acute symptoms of respiratory irritation and shellfish harvesting closures so called low levels or    to    cells per liter can cause fish kills once you get to medium and high red tide represents a serious health threat to exposed populations keeping in mind that one does not have to be at the beach to be affected as red tide brevetoxins are aerosolized made airborne via wave action and can be carried on the wind many miles inshore in fact at so called low levels more than    cellsliter the saturation of karenia brevis is already significant enough that it can be detected by satellite at present levels along the affected southwest florida gulf coast have reached high in several areas including off the coast of lee county where i am presently reporting from i can speak directly from experience that this is a particularly noxious outbreak for instance i had a bronchial asthma attack for the first time in   years and have found myself my family and the local community i serve to be at greatly increased susceptibility to prolonged cold and flu bouts over the past five months another important consideration is that red tide sampling occurs primarily in surface water   surface sampling   bottom sampling the problem is that karenia brevis blooms have been found to penetrate coastal waters along the bottom without surface expression until nearshore this means that negative surface findings do not necessarily indicate the absence of a problem so what is the real cause of prolonged near to shore red tide outbreaks so back to the question are these outbreaks entirely natural phenomena as many health authorities and certainly folks within the mainstream media tourist and real estate industry often maintain the answer is a resolute and resounding no in april   the journal aquatic microbial ecology published a groundbreaking study titled grazing by karenia brevis on synechococcus enhances its growth rate and may help to sustain blooms which provided the missing link in how red tide is directly fed by human land based activities here is the study abstract abstract grazing rates of karenia brevis clones ccmp  and ccmp  were determined in laboratory experiments using synechococcus sp clone ccmp  as food grazing by k brevis thus enhances the range of nutritional substrates available to meet its growth requirements and may play a substantial role in sustaining natural populations in inorganic n poor waters with evidence that blooms of synechococcus can be enhanced due to anthropogenic nutrients the potential importance of this particulate nutrient source for sustaining red tide blooms in situ is large and may help to resolve the current uncertainty as to how k brevis blooms are maintained it can now be hypothesized that as cyanobacterial blooms increase so too does the potential for karenia brevis growth to be enhanced and for blooms to be sustained through grazing especially under the low light conditions associated with bloom self shading recognition of this pathway is at least one step toward reconciling the long term reported increase in k brevis blooms eg brand compton   and the tendency for blooms of this species to develop offshore in seemingly oligotrophic waters eg vargo et al     what this research essentially proves is that the runoff from land based applications of urea nitrogen fertilizers such as commonly used in lawn care as well as additional sources of nitrogen urea from septic tanks sewage spills and close to water sewage treatment effluent result in synachoccus blooms which is a harmless green slime algae have you noticed the green slime at your beach karenia brevis red tide uses the green slime as an energy source the more synachoccus the more red tide simple cause and effect at the root of the problem are nitrogen urea fertilizers which are overused in florida lawn care practices as well as in florida agriculture more on this later according to a sierra club report linking fertilizers to red tide blooms residential fertilizer use in the state of florida increased by     tons or   from   to   aloneii one might ask the question to floridians is the health of your lawns read aesthetic appearance more important than the health of the gulf of mexico and by implication your own health ironically plants need primarily magnesium for chlorophyll and potassium and not nearly as much nitrogen which is presently being used at up to   times higher levels than required in fact excess nitrogen leads to plasmolysis in plants causing excess water to leave the plant entering the soil resulting in wilting the excess nitrogen of course leaches into the soil and eventually a portion of its causes water pollution the obvious solution to the accelerating red tide problem is to reduce land based applications of urea nitrogen especially in the summer months as the green slime is reduced the red tide will have no additional energy source and will die out how red tide adversely affects human health in order to understand how red tide affects human health one must first understand brevetoxins the primary poisons produced by this organism there are at least   and as many as   brevetoxins divided into two classes brevetoxin a and brevetoxin b with   subtypes characterized among brevetoxin a and   subtypes among brevetoxin b brevetoxins are extremely toxic the brevetoxin b subtype pb tx  for instance has an oral ld  the acutely lethal dose that kills   of the test group equivalent to cyanide   mgkg at    mgkg in the   mouse model of acute exposure no one truly knows the extent of the synergistic toxicity associated with exposure to all     brevetoxins simultaneously which is what may occur in real world exposure because it has not to my knowledge been researched brevetoxins are known primarily as a neurotoxic they bind to voltage gated sodium channels in nerve cells leading to disruption of nerve transmission and in some cases nerve cell death animal research indicates that as little as   days of subacute exposure to the brevetoxin b pbtx   is sufficient to induce neuronal degeneration in a discrete reason of the mouse cerebral cortexiii in humans a condition known as neurotoxic shellfish poisoning nsp caused by the consumption of shellfish contaminated by brevetoxins has been identified symptoms include vomiting and nausea and a variety of neurological symptoms such as slurred speechiv of course lower concentrations especially in more susceptible populations already suffering from neurological issues likely contribute to these symptoms as well as headache myalgias muscle soreness and related aches and pains that would be hard to attribute to such an invisible toxin whose health threat is generally downplayed by the media and medical establishment neurotoxicity however is only the tip of the iceberg a   study published in the journal of toxicology and environmental health found that the immune system and not the nervous system is the primary target of brevetoxinsv animals exposed to brevetoxin saw a more than   suppression of humoral immunity a   study confirmed this findingvi then in   it was found that brevetoxin a inhalation worsens the pulmonary response to influenza a in the male rat vii the study authors concluded these results suggest that repeated inhalation exposure to brevetoxin may delay virus particle clearance and recovery from influenza a infection in the rat lung this finding indicates that red tide blooms may therefore worsen the seasonal flu epidemics that commonly afflict the southwest florida especially when the bloom persists into the fall and winter months as is the present case it is already well known that hospital verified cases of respiratory issues can increase by over   during sustained red tide outbreaksviii considering that much of the mortality associated with influenza infection is associated with pneumonia complications reducing red tide outbreaks via fertilizer use reductions should be considered a top priority by health authorities but the adverse health effects do not end with neurotoxicity and immunotoxicity as serious gastrointestinal complaints may also follow from red tide exposure a   study examined whether the presence of a florida red tide bloom affected the rates of admission for a gastrointestinal diagnosis to a hospital emergency room in sarasota flix according to the study the rates of gastrointestinal diagnoses admissions were compared for a   month time period in   when florida red tide bloom was present onshore to the same   month period in   when no florida red tide bloom occurred a significant   increase in the total number of gastrointestinal emergency room admissions for the florida red tide bloom period was found compared to the non red tide period we can therefore add gastrointestinal issues to the growing list of red tide associated health issues other potential health effects that have been noted in the biomedical literature include so what can be done   reduce exposure first if you live in south florida remember to monitor your areas levels by visiting the status maps please keep in mind that proximity is not the only factor in exposure due to the well known aerosolization of these toxins and the inability of surface water testing to fully reveal its presence next visit the site windmapscom to see if the winds are moving inshore or going offshore this simple step may enable you to reduce exposure by reducing time outside and certainly keeping off the beach on days that aerosolized red tide brevetoxins may be moving inshore also consider that if you are driving keep the air circulating within the cabin unfortunately there is nothing you can do if your ac unit is continually pulling air from outside inside your home but you could reduce your ac usage on these days eating cooling foods and wear lighter clothing for instance   reduce toxic effects the primary mechanism through which brevetoxins cause respiratory harm is through ige independent mast cell activationx mast cells are immune cells which if over activated can produce a wide range of potentially harmful substances such as keeping this in mind preventing mast cell degranulation with safe non drug alternatives such as nettles extract may be an ideal approach to the problem several companies provide extracts which concentrate the compounds within nettles that inhibit mast cell degranulation eg new chapters histamine take care vahs allerblock while we do not endorse any product as this runs counter to our mission statement you will see no ads on greenmedinfocom for any dietary supplement we feel compelled to inform our readers that alternatives to antihistamine drugs like benadryl do exist also please remember to do your own research in tandem with consulting a licensed health care practitioner before embarking on a path of self care other potential histamine blocking compounds that have been researched can be found on our histamine antagonist page histamine antagonist   contribute to the long term solution the long term solution is to reduce the use of nitrogen urea fertilizers in both lawn and agricultural applications there is no question that nitrogen urea rich agricultural runoff primarily from the sugarcane and citrus industries are sizable contributors to the overall nitrogen burden in the gulf of mexico much of big sugars agricultural runoff ends up in lake okeechobee which eventually empties into the gulf of mexico a   study published in the journal biogeochemistry titled escalating worldwide use of urea a global change contributing to coastal eutrophication indicates worldwide use of urea as a nitrogen fertilizer and feed additive has increased more than   fold in the past   decades the study pointed out long thought to be retained in soils new data are suggestive of signicant overland transport of urea to sensitive coastal waters urea concentrations in coastal and estuarine waters can be substantially elevated and can represent a large fraction of the total dissolved organic nitrogen pool urea is used as a nitrogen substrate by many coastal phytoplankton and is increasingly found to be important in the nitrogenous nutrition of some harmful algal bloom hab species they also noted that the global increase from   to   in documented incidences of paralytic shellsh poisoning caused by several hab species is similar to the global increase in urea use over the same   decades the reality is that these agricultural practices have been a long time in the making and will take considerable time energy and political clout to change the good news is that you can make changes at the local level from the bottom up as it were by starting with your own lawn you can also organize at a county level to enact ordinances that restrict fertilizer use as ed rosenthal founder of the non profit organization advocate the precautionary principle has done with great success in sarasota county these results are encouraging and indicate that we can build a grassroots movement with an end goal to enact stricter regulations at the state level resources ii sierra club fertilizer use and

4,last week rodriguez created a political committee bankrolled with   million from a national labor coalition to oppose the very same idea its not the interests of farmworkers that have changed the ufws about face appears to have been a clumsy attempt at political blackmail in the final days of the legislative session gov arnold schwarzenegger again insisted that he would sign a package of bills addressing the states critical water needs only if it included a bond issue that would finance construction of dams or a canal to move water from north to south at the time the governor reiterated his ultimatum a bill was sitting on his desk designed to make it easier for unions to organize farmworkers the ufw no longer would have to win secret ballot elections to represent workers it simply could collect signed cards from a majority of employees at a particular ranch schwarzenegger has vetoed similar bills three times so this time the ufw opted for a new tactic    a veiled threat that unless the governor signed this bill the union would oppose the water bond he wanted the linkage was convoluted at best before considering any state water deal lawmakers and the governor must ensure that farmworkers have access to clean cool drinking water and shade state democratic party chairman john burton wrote in a note suggesting ufw supporters lobby the governor   the only recourse for farmworkers to protect themselves would be through the collective bargaining process as provided for in sb   the ufws bill dovetailed with the national labor movements top priority    legislation to create a similar card check mechanism on the federal level unions consider the change vital to offset rules that enable employers to stall elections and intimidate workers a card check law for california farmworkers might help propel the national bill which is why change to win a six union coalition led by the service employees international union donated   million to fund the ufws anti water bond campaign the move backfired one of the governors top advisers denounced it as an intimidation tactic and schwarzenegger plucked the ufw bill from the stack of pending laws and vetoed it that left the ufw trying to justify a position at odds with its historic support for water bonds which rodriguez once hailed as good for both growers and farmworkers last week the unions organizing director offered this remarkable rationale for the unions opposition to water bonds if more water is available for agriculture ufw vice president armando elenes wrote in a note to a longtime ufw supporter who then posted it on an internet listserv the growers would continue abusing the workers and the jobs that will be created will not be good jobs that attitude shouldnt come as a surprise to leaders of change to win formed in   with the promise that the new collaboration would increase union membership one of the coalitions first ventures was a million dollar organizing campaign in the san joaquin valley vineyards an attempt to revitalize the ufw and turn around a legacy of neglect in the fields the large unions in change to win poured in people and dollars to help their tiny partner but the campaign failed the ufw could not repair decades of mistrust in a few short weeks and a majority of workers at a large vineyard voted decisively against joining the union in the three years since workers have decertified the ufw at several of the remaining california workplaces where it has contracts and the union represents only a tiny fraction of state farmworkers those members dues last year totaled just more than    million according to federal filings and the ufw reports barely    in its long dormant political action committee so the   million donation from change to win represents a significant windfall its not a huge sum for change to win but when seiu president andy stern led the coalitions exodus from the afl cio he promised that change to win would focus on effective organizing stern is currently enmeshed in costly divisive fights on several fronts he is fighting the union representing his own employees fighting the deposed leaders of a california health care local fighting his former ally the hotel employees and restaurant employees international union and fighting the schwarzenegger administration over furloughs and budget cuts    all at a time when the labor movement has an extraordinary opportunity to make national gains with a sympathetic administration and congress now that the water bond for card check gambit has failed stern might want to reconsider and redirect change to wins   million into a fight that actually benefits workers rather than one aimed at eliminating their jobs and the ufw might want to stop finding excuses and begin the difficult work necessary to take advantage of the   law that makes california the only state where farmworkers have the right to union elections pawel is the author of the forthcoming book the

3,signs that we are near the peak of an absolutely massive stock market bubblemichael snyder in fact google searches for the term stock bubble are now at the highest level that we have seen since november   despite assurances from the mainstream media and the federal reserve that everything is just fine many americans are beginning to realize that we have seen this movie before we saw it during the dotcom bubble and we saw it during the lead up to the horrible financial crisis of   so precisely when will the bubble burst this time nobody knows for sure but without a doubt this irrational financial bubble will burst at some point remember a bubble is always the biggest right before it bursts and the following are   signs that we are near the peak of an absolutely massive stock market bubble   bob shiller one of the winners of this years nobel prize for economics says that bubbles look like this and that he is most worried about the boom in the us stock market   the total amount of margin debt has risen by   percent since january   and it is now at the highest level ever recorded the last two times that margin debt skyrocketed like this were just before the bursting of the dotcom bubble in   and just before the financial crisis of   when this house of cards comes crashing down things are going to get very messy when the tablecloth gets pulled out from under the place settings youre going to have a lot of them crash and smash on the floor said uri landesman president of platinum partners hedge fund that margins going to get pulled and everyones going to have to cover thats when you get really serious corrections   market research firm trimtabs says that the sp   is very overpriced right now   marc faber recently told cnbc that we are in a gigantic speculative bubble   in the united states google searches for the term stock bubble are at the highest level that we have seen since november   just before the last stock market crash   price to earnings ratios are very high right now the dow was trading at    times the past four quarters of earnings of its   components according to the wall street journal on friday that was up from    times its earnings a year ago the sp   is trading at    times earnings the nasdaq   index is trading at    times earnings at the very least the ratios are signaling that stock prices are rich

lost    million dollars last quarter but according to the financial markets it is currently worth about   billion dollars   right now facebook is trading at a valuation that is equivalent to approximately   years of earnings and it is currently supposedly worth about   billion dollars   howard marks of oaktree capital recently stated that he believes that markets are riskier than at any time since the depths of the    crisis   as graham summers recently noted retail investors are buying stocks at a level not seen since the peak of the dotcom bubble back in     david stockman a former director of the office of management and budget under president ronald reagan believes that this financial bubble is going to end very badly we have a massive bubble everywhere from japan to china europe to the uk as a result of this i think world financial markets are extremely dangerous unstable and subject to serious trouble and dislocation in the future   bob janjuah of nomura securities believes that there could be a   to   sell off in global stock markets over the next couple of years   according to tyler durden of zero hedge the us stock market is repeating a pattern that we have seen many times before according to him we are experiencing a well defined syndrome of overvalued overbought overbullish rising yield conditions that has appeared exclusively at speculative market peaks including exhaustively             before a market loss of nearly   that was truncated by investor faith in a new round of monetary easing and at three points in   february may and today as i mentioned at the top of this article this stock market bubble has been fueled by quantitative easing easy money from the fed has been artificially inflating stock prices and this has greatly benefited a very small percentage of the us population in fact   percent of all individually held stocks are owned by the wealthiest   percent of all americans when this stock market bubble does burst those wealthy americans are going to be in for a tremendous amount of pain but there are some people out there that argue that what we are witnessing is not a stock market bubble at all that includes janet yellen the new head of the federal reserve recentlyshe insisted that there is absolutely nothing to be worried about stock prices have risen pretty robustly yellen said but i think that if you look at traditional valuation measures you would not see stock prices in territory that suggests bubble like conditions we shall see who was right and who was wrong lets all file that one away and come back to it in a few years so where are stocks going next if you had the answer to that question you could probably make a lot of money yes the current bubble could burst at any moment or stocks could continue going up for a little while longer after all the sp   has risen in december about   percent of the time over the past thirty years perhaps that will be the case this december as well perhaps

1,secret recordings of a suspect talking about the clinton foundation fueled an internal battle between fbi agents who wanted to pursue the case and corruption prosecutors who viewed the statements as worthless hearsay people familiar with the matter said   agents using informants and recordings from unrelated corruption investigations thought they had found enough material to merit aggressively pursuing the investigation into the foundation that started in summer   based on claims made in a book by a conservative author called clinton cash the untold story of how and why foreign governments and businesses helped make bill and hillary rich these people said   the account of the case and resulting dispute comes from interviews with officials at multiple agencies   starting in february and continuing today investigators from the federal bureau of investigation and public corruption prosecutors became increasingly frustrated with each other as often happens within and between departments at the center of the tension stood the us attorney for brooklyn robert capers who some at the fbi came to view as exacerbating the problems by telling each side what it wanted to hear these people said through a spokeswoman mr capers declined to comment   the roots of the dispute lie in a disagreement over the strength of the case these people said which broadly centered on whether clinton foundation contributors received favorable treatment from the state department under hillary clinton   senior officials in the justice department and the fbi didnt think much of the evidence while investigators believed they had promising leads their bosses wouldnt let them pursue they said   these details on the probe are emerging amid the continuing furor surrounding fbi director james comeys disclosure to congress that new emails had emerged that could be relevant to a separate previously closed fbi investigation of mrs clintons email arrangement while she was secretary of state   on wednesday president barack obama took the unusual step of criticizing the fbi when asked about mr comeys disclosure of the emails   amid the internal finger pointing on the clinton foundation matter some have blamed the fbis no   official deputy director andrew mccabe claiming he sought to stop agents from pursuing the case this summer his defenders deny that and say it was the justice department that kept pushing back on the investigation
1,attorney general william barr has revealed that john durhams investigation into the origins of the russian collusion hoax has uncovered evidence far more troubling than what could be explained away as mistakes or sloppiness  ag barr told fox news host laura ingraham on thursday that connecticuts top federal prosecutor is unearthing troubling evidence and promised prosecutions will happen if he finds that laws were broken  my own view is that the evidence shows that were not dealing with just mistakes or sloppiness barr said  there is something far more troubling here and were going to get to the bottom of it he continued  and if people broke the law and we can establish that with the evidence they will be prosecuted  washingtonexaminercom reports durham was appointed last year by barr to investigate the origins of the trump russia investigation and to review possible misconduct by federal law enforcement and intelligence officials the review upgraded into a criminal investigation in the fall giving the prosecutor the power to impanel a grand jury and hand down indictments the attorney general told durham to focus just as much on the time period after the   election as before it  he is looking to bring to justice people who are engaged in abuses if he can show that they were criminal violations and thats what the focus is on barr said and as you know being a lawyer you yourself building these cases  especially the kinds of sprawling case we have between us that went on for two or three years here  it takes some time  it takes some time to build the case so hes diligently pursuing it  special counsel robert muellers   page report released in april found the russians had interfered in the   election in a sweeping and systematic fashion but did not establish any criminal conspiracy between the trump campaign and russia barr suggested there would also likely end up being a durham report  well i think a report maybe  and probably  will be a byproduct of his activity barr told ingraham  doj inspector general michael horowitzs lengthy december report criticized the justice department and the fbi for at least   significant errors and omissions related to the foreign intelligence surveillance act warrants against trump campaign associate carter page and for the bureaus reliance on british ex spy christopher steeles salacious and unverified dossier steele put his research together at the behest of the opposition research firm fusion gps funded by hillary clintons presidential campaign and the democratic national committee through the perkins coie law firm horowitz also criticized the bureau for not sharing exculpatory information from confidential human sources with the fisa court  i think its possible to put in a regime that would make it very hard either to willfully circumvent fisa or to do so sloppily without due regard for the rights of the american person involved and also to make it very clear that any misconduct will be discovered and discovered fairly promptly barr told ingraham so i do think we can put in safeguards that will enable us to go forward with this important tool  the attorney general added the people who abused fisa have a lot to answer for  fbi lawyer kevin clinesmith who altered a document in the page fisa filings is the only person publicly known to be under criminal investigation by durham the justice department told the fisa court it believed the final two of four page fisa warrants were not valid and the fbi has moved to sequester all of the information gleaned from the page surveillance  fbi director christopher wray agreed there had been at least some illegal surveillance and said he was working to claw back that fisa information  in the wake of horowitzs report barr said that many questions remain unanswered pointing to former fbi director james comeys refusal to allow his security clearance to be reinstated which let him avoid questions about classified information that horowitz wanted to raise barr and durham both quibbled with horowitzs conclusion that the crossfire hurricane investigation was properly predicated in the summer of    durham drove to washington dc in march to ensure the investigation stayed on track during the coronavirus outbreak he is reportedly looking into whether obama era cia director john brennan took politicized actions during the   intelligence community assessment on russian interference  he is also reportedly scrutinizing brennan in relation to steeles dossier and whether it was used in the   assessment why comey and former fbi deputy director andrew mccabe insisted upon it being part of the assessment and how allegations from the dossier ended up in the assessments appendix  i think the president has every right to be frustrated because i think what happened to him was one of the greatest travesties in american history barr argued to ingraham without any basis they started this investigation of his campaign and even more concerning actually is what happened after the campaign a whole pattern of events while he was president to sabotage his presidency  or at least have the effect of sabotaging the presidency  barr has become a polarizing figure while overseeing this investigation for which trump gave him full declassification authority and democrats have accused him of going to extreme lengths to protect trump barr and durham have reached out to foreign governments including australia italy and the united kingdom taking multiple overseas trips to review evidence  during the thursday interview barr also weighed in on trumps decision to fire intelligence community inspector general michael atkinson whose handling of last years ukraine whistleblower complaint drew trumps ire but whose removal raised eyebrows among republicans such as sen chuck grassley  from the vantage point of the department of justice he had interpreted his statute which is a fairly narrow statute that gave him jurisdiction over wrongdoing by intelligence people and tried to turn it into a commission to explore anything in the government and immediately reported to congress without letting the executive branch look at it and determine whether there was any problem barr said adding so i think the president was correct in firing him
4,not going however would really be a shame because this powerfully told devastating film directed by max farberbock aimee  jaguar and starring german actress of the moment nina hoss is everything you want in adult narrative cinema its intelligent provocative and intensely dramatic its subject matter may be tough but it is as powerfully authentic as anyone could want a woman in berlin is based on a book subtitled eight weeks in the conquered city and written anonymously in the form of an expanded diary that dealt with the russian occupation of berlin at the end of world war ii the book first saw the light of day as an english translation published in   and was not published in germany until five years later the reaction there was frankly incendiary with one writer accusing it of besmirching the honor of german women the outrage and condemnation the work was met with so unnerved the writer that she vowed not to allow the book to be reprinted until after her death and insisted on remaining anonymous even into the grave when woman was finally republished in   it at last received the recognition it was due as a devastating unswervingly unsentimental account of one of the wars last taboo areas for though it has not often been dealt with or even recognized the period of soviet occupation of a half deserted berlin populated largely by women resulted in what historians estimate was    rapes as one of the characters in the film puts it berlin is one big whorehouse a woman in berlin however is not a documentary and the triumph of writer director farberbock is to have constructed a story that illuminates this period while focusing intensely on the life of one woman the anonymous diarist exceptionally played by hoss he expands on sections of the book to make the story more dramatic without diluting its powerful essence the film opens with berlin in ruins and the russians in the process of taking over and its immediately clear how convincingly the physicality of a city reduced to rubble has been captured after a quick flashback illustrating how confident the germans were of ultimate victory berlin returns for good to the wrenching despair of being on the losing side through the eyes of the anonymous narrator a sophisticated journalist who had traveled in   countries and lived in paris london and moscow we experience the initial jolt of a nightmare from which there is no awakening no escape the individual rapes the citys women are subjected to are shown only briefly but it is the number of them that is overwhelming as well as how quickly they become the norm one of the most telling moments in the film comes when the narrator runs into elke aimee  jaguars juliane kohler a friend from before the war its casually chilling when after initial hugs the two ask each other nonchalantly how often and you know without being told exactly what they are referring to but because they have to survive these women do not have the luxury of bottomless despair much of a woman in berlin involves what people are capable of doing to stay alive in a lowest common denominator situation where conventional morality is a distinct liability and people are more than willing to step over corpses to get to a jar of jam what the narrator who has the advantage of speaking rudimentary russian chooses to do is decide who gets me having determined that a pact with one devil is better than many she searches for someone who will protect her from the hordes in return for sexual exclusivity her only fear she says is being ambushed by her heart the narrator soon in effect propositions a high ranking russian major named andrej evgeny sidikhin and so begins the liaison that forms the spine of the film it becomes more real than either party intends but it would be a mistake to give it a name that means something only in a peacetime context built on an incendiary combination of power attraction and deprivation it is a relationship that could happen only during the particular kind of saturnalia that the chaos of war breeds misfortune has a greater imagination than we do the narrator says at one point and that could well be the motto of this brutal unforgettable film
1,the whistleblowing organization also released barack obamas personal emails showing that president bush organized his transition to the highest office in the land before the   election posted on october     by baxter dmitry wikileaks couldnt have made it clearer in a series of tweets on thursday  the us election for the president of the united states is rigged the establishment have selected their president and by hook or crook she will be elected   responding to allegations that wikileaks recent leaks have outed it as playing partisan politics wikileaks fired back   you are not a fan of publishing true information about corrupt ruling power factions who will take power on jan      on the day wikileaks publicized the release of emails from barack obamas personal account their twitter account then stated that the outcome of the election was planned from the outset  what election it has been clear from the beginning who is going to win this is in effect a power consolidation exercise    considering what we now know about the behind the scenes rigging of the democratic primary the collusion between the dnc establishment and mainstream media and the fact hillary clinton pushed for donald trumps gop nomination can you possibly disagree   are presidents elected or selected   wikileaks emails from barack obamas personal email account reveal that the bush administration contacted the future president multiple times before the election secretly organizing the transition of power   the   transition had gone down in history as surprisingly smooth martha joynt kumar in a book about the transition said it  was the best in anyones memory in part because    made everyone recognize that a transition is fragile time    todays revelations raise questions about why it was so smooth  suggestions obama was selected by the shadow government rather than elected by the people are no longer tinfoil hat territory   the most eye catching email in todays leak contains a message from john podesta about an invitation from president george w bush to the president elect   should that have read president select podesta sent the email to obama before the election result was known   but it gets even worse   the emails show a transition plan was being worked on long before the   election had taken place according to an attached memo in one of the emails obama was already discussing his transition to office with members of the bush administration including then treasury secretary hank paulson prior to the election    as you have observed in your interactions with secretary paulson he is apparently eager to involve you and your transition team extensively in his policy choices following the election  are presidents elected or selected   another attached memo acknowledges that it was unusual to start the transition process so soon    we are now at the point of deciding how to staff economic policy during the transition who should be the point of contact with treasury and how to blend the transition and campaign economic policy talent   normally these decisions could be made after the election and ideally after the selection of a national economic advisor but of course these are not normal times    not normal times perhaps not in   but eight years later it seems nothing has changed what was not normal in   has become very much the norm in
4,its being characterized by the state    and reported by much of the media    as merely a cash advance or interest free loan nobodys tax liability increases so its not really a tax increase not technically no well ive yet to hear a convincing explanation of how the state can make big money on the deal    permanently    without its being a tax hike bottom line when the state increases its tax revenue by tapping paychecks thats a tax increase in this case its a one time tax increase sure youll get a refund in april if too much tax has been withheld or if you still owe taxes youll write a smaller check but then youll give the money right back to the state as the same withholding scheme continues indefinitely year after year to actually recapture the money and keep it    to finally catch up with the nimble fingered tax collector    youll have to quit working or die its like this analogy you pay    rent april   as you do the first of each month then the landlord says hell need the future rent   days earlier but not to worry the rent wont increase on april   you pay    for may but wait a minute now youve forked out    in april youll pay another    in may and each month thereafter until you decide to move finally your last month living in the rental you make no payment only then do you recoup the    extra payment made that long ago april but lets return to taxes and back up to the beginning desperate to close a   billion deficit hole gov arnold schwarzenegger proposed and the legislature passed a speedup in personal income tax withholding starting nov   the withholding increased by   percent generating a projected    billion revenue bump in the current fiscal year additionally starting in   taxpayers required to make quarterly estimated payments will be told to send in   percent during the first half of the calendar year the state figures to make   million off that during the current fiscal year so all told its a   billion one time boost in personal income tax revenue and dont be distracted by words such as liability and refund for the state to truly return the money    rather than merely refunding it with one hand and grabbing it back with the other    the governor and legislature would need to reinstate the previous withholding and estimated payment systems and theyre not going to do that at least for the foreseeable future because it would cost   billion the state already is facing another budget deficit of around   billion so the policymakers wont be providing one time tax cuts which is what returning to the old withholding system would amount to besides they probably wouldnt get credit from the public for a tax cut anyway because theyve never owned up to hiking taxes in the first place the reason its not a tax increase insists brenda voet spokesperson for the franchise tax board is that people have the opportunity to change the amount of withholding thank you brenda thats the only way to avoid the tax hike call your employers payroll department and adjust the withholding allowances to block sacramentos money snatchers one state tax expert    who didnt want to be identified for fear of being fired    questions how many quarterly taxpayers will go along with the prepayment front loading so the projected revenue increase could fall short republican legislators    all of whom had vowed not to raise taxes    smelled an odor and unanimously opposed the revenue speedups so did five democratic moderates some concerned about their next political campaigns democrats were able to pass the legislation on a simple majority vote rather than needing two thirds because the legislatures attorney ruled it wasnt a tax increase maybe not legally not technically but certainly logically and mathematically you wouldnt graduate from finance   if you didnt realize that if you increase withholding or estimated tax payments youre increasing taxes says tom campbell former state finance director and congressman longtime economics professor and current candidate for the republican gubernatorial nomination its just dishonest to say thats not a tax increase when campbell told me that recently he was referring merely to the taxpayers lost use of their withheld money    its time value and potential for earning interest he didnt realize that the accelerated withholding would continue indefinitely taking a bigger tax bite i didnt know about the out years he says in sacramento speak referring to the future isnt that something jon coupal president of the howard jarvis taxpayers association puts it this way if a mugger sticks a gun in your face and says give me   and ill give it back next year its still robbery especially if the robber gives it back and then demands another   its just horrible policy asserts the anti tax crusader oh i dont know you could argue the policy is fine given the states cash crisis    a relatively painless way to avoid more painful cuts in public services but be up front and call it what it is a one time tax increase its simple if the state makes money off taxpayers the taxpayers lose money its the old duck test about walking and quacking if it smells like a tax increase and acts like a tax increase its not a short term loan skelton is a times columnist e mail him at georgeskeltonlatimescom

1,if trump loses it will defy the data trend for the first time in the last   years since internet engagement began in full earnest  sanjav rai indian inventor of the mogia artificial intelligence system in     according to a report in the international business times ibt  the artificial intelligence ai system that accurately predicted the outcomes of the last three us presidential elections has put trump ahead of hillary clinton in the race for the white house   the ai system called mogia was created in   by sanjiv rai founder of indian it company genicai   the system works by processing   million data points from public platforms including google facebook twitter and youtube the ibt explained   it then analyzes the information to generate predictions taking into account data such as engagement with tweets and viewership of facebook live videos   if trump loses it will defy the data trend for the first time in the last   years developer rai was quoted as saying   having already correctly predicted the winners of the democratic and republican primaries the system found that people are   percent more engaged with trump than they were with barack obama at his peak in  the year he was elected president   while most algorithms suffer from programmersdevelopers biases mogia aims at learning from her environment developing her own rules at the policy layer and develop expert systems without discarding any data rai said   in september this year professor allan lichtman from washington dcs american university  told the washington post that trump is most likely to win based on a system of truefalse statement that he calls keys to the white house   professor lichtman who the newspaper added had correctly predicted the winner of every presidential election since   said he based his predictions on   truefalse questions where an answer of true always favors the reelection of the party holding the white house   if six or more of the   keys are false  that is they go against the party in power  they lose if fewer than six are false the party in power gets four more years he said   these keys include questions about who holds the most seats in the us house of representatives the lack of a significant third party campaign the economy the extent of a real policy change should a challenger win the level of social unrest foreign and military policies   the keys have nothing to do with presidential approval polls or horse race polls professor lichtman said going on to make it evident that he personally dislikes trump a great deal however on his system the democratic party has definitely lost five of the keys and is well on course to lose a sixth which he said would give the election to trump by default   the new observer has long predicted that trump can only win if at least   percent of whites turn out to vote and that he takes at least two thirds of the white vote anything less than that will see a liberal minority white vote team up with the block nonwhite vote to grant clinton victorywhich was exactly how obama was twice elected

1,a major increase in state surveillance is a price worth paying to beat the coronavirus according to the tony blair institute for global change tbi  the uk think tank founded by the former prime minister says it could offer an escape route from the crisis  in a report the institute says there should be a digital credential to help lift lockdown restrictions it would be a type of digital certificate that could identify those who have immunity to the virus and are fit to return to work though it notes an alternative would be necessary for those without a smartphone  the report also argues that the public must accept a level of intrusion that would normally be out of the question in liberal democracies  the guardian reports governments and private companies can use location data to track the success of lockdown measures monitor bluetooth signals to help contact tracing efforts or keep an eye on search queries to help identify new clusters of infection or previously unknown symptoms  privacy activists have warned however that such extensions of surveillance could be a dangerous precedent that would be hard to roll back once the crisis is over  the tbi argues in the report published on friday that those fears are valid but understate the degree of trade off that many countries face  carefully applied technology gives policymakers a possible way through the crisis that reduces otherwise very high costs in terms of lives lost and livelihoods destroyed said chris yiu the institutes executive director of technology and public policy but this escape route comes with a price dramatically increased technological surveillance under the right conditions this is a price worth paying  in normal times the degree of monitoring and state intervention we are talking about here would be out of the question in liberal democracies yiu continued but these are not normal times and the alternatives are even more unpalatable this is quite different from the traditional debate about whether confronting security threats to our way of life merits sacrificing the values of freedom and privacy that define us  covid   is not an ideology and rebalancing the contract between citizens and the state to take advantage of the capabilities of new technologies is not capitulation  as a result governments should consider a number of interventions that might normally cross the line yiu said for instance states could require technology platforms to share in aggregate form search and social media trends and telemetry from wearables and other connected devices to help them respond to the crisis and they could share patient data internationally to accelerate the search for treatments and vaccines rather than putting up walls around national health services as they would in normal times
3,when truth is suppressed countries diedr paul craig roberts america we were told was moving upscale our new role in the world economy was to innovate and develop the new products that the dirty fingernail economies would produce the money was in the innovation they said not in the simple task of production as i consistently warned the high wage service economy based on imagination and ingenuity that harvard professor and offshoring advocate michael porter promised us as our reward for giving up dirty fingernail jobs was a figment of porters imagination over the decade i repeated myself many times innovation takes place where things are made innovation will move abroad with the manufacturing this is not what corporations or their shills such as porter wanted to hear corporations were boosting their profits by getting rid of their american employees and replacing them with lowly paid foreigners porters job was to reassure the sheeple so that no outcry would materialize against the greed that was hollowing out the us economy now comes a study conducted by   mit professors and their graduate students that concludes on the basis of the facts that the loss of companies that can make things will end up in the loss of research than can invent them source two years ago in   a nobel prize winning economist michael spence confirmed my decade old conclusion that the us economy no longer had the capability to create any jobs except low wage domestic service jobs that do not produce tradable goods and services that can be exported to reduce the massive us trade deficit spence validated my argument that the new economy was the offshored economy spence concluded that the outlook for the us economy and us employment is dire the us faces a long term structural challenge with respect to the quantity and quality of employment opportunities in the united states a related set of challenges concerns the income distribution almost all incremental employment has occurred in the non tradable sector which has experienced much slower growth in value added per employee because that number is highly correlated with income it goes a long way to explain the stagnation of wages across large segments of the workforce source there has been no more public policy response to spences conclusion than to my identical conclusion we have heard all our lives that ideas are the most powerful force and prevail over material interests perhaps this was once true but that would have been in previous times when material interests did not control the media the universities and the publishing companies along with the government voices such as mine that of a high us treasury official and that of spence a nobel prize winner cannot compete with the voices paid by big money today the bulk of the population knows nothing except the propaganda fed to them by the oligarchic interests they sit in front of fox news or cnn and ingest it all those who fancy themselves more sophisticated get the same dose of lies from the new york times if those who speak truth cannot be bought off or shut up they are ignored or demonized almost everything americans need to know is off limits in public discussion anyone who broaches the truth becomes an anti american a terrorist sympathizer a commie socialist a conspiracy theorist an anti semite a kook or some other name designed to scare americans away from the message of truth the corrupt corporations the corrupt media and the corrupt us government have insulated the country from truth the result will be a massive crash a country built on lies is like a house built on sand therefore everyone who hears these words of mine and puts them into practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock the rain came down the streams rose and the winds blew and beat against that house yet it did not fall because it had its foundation on the rock truth but everyone who hears these words of mine and does not put them into practice is like a foolish man who built his house on sand liesthe rain came down the streams rose and the winds blew and beat against that house and it fell with a great crash matthew      niv this article first appeared at paul craig roberts new website institute for political economy paul craig roberts was assistant secretary of the treasury for economic policy and associate editor of the wall street journal he was columnist for business week scripps howard news service and creators syndicate he has had many university appointments his internet columns have attracted a worldwide following

3,new documentary overcast   a breakthrough in the research of geoengineering and chemtrailsby selfnews post matthias conducted over   interviews in   different countries and spent thousands of hours on research and investigation to find out more about the aerosol spraying and why our public officials are not investigating it overcast incorporated both sides of the controversy the debunkers and established scientists as well as the activists the film brilliantly shows how the debunkers debunk themselves with their limited argumentation and lack of scientific data for the first time in the movements history matthias took samples directly out of the trails back in   this research flight is not in the film but can be seen under the following link httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvz pals yfum the other two flights are building the red line of the film after the film was almost completed a very rare study from the swiss federal institute of technology came out with some groundbreaking results unregulated metals of aluminum and barium were found in the jet fuel as described in many geoengineering patents eg welsbach huko overcast is a movie that every activist should watch in order to get the best arguments show it to your skeptical and unaware friends to wake them up it is a film that gives the whole issue and movement the credibility needed in order to stop this crime overcast has already been shown in over   film festivals worldwide here is the link to view the online version of overcast watch or get your copy now if he had really found evidence of chemtrails it would be actual news but ive looked and looked and never found these self proclaimed investigators demonstrating anything but normal levels of aluminum and other elements stop looking at fake news i guess youre right why should i look at sites which claim to have made scientific breakthroughs with no proof or if youre seriously telling me you think this guy finally discovered chemtrails after all these years where everyone else tried and failed please link me to his thorough research which backs up his extraordinary claims thanks in advance i am not aware of anyone else in this space who failed to identify chem trails in fact edward teller admitted that he played a key role in designing chem trails back in the  s the concern that the sun would bake earth caused various nuclear scientists like teller to come up with the reflect back theory which underscores most of the chem trail ideology also there have been major droughts in california starting in the early  s and the methodology used to cause precipitation was chem trails these scientists ignored the obvious health issues in favor of cooling the earth and causing rain cloud seeding is not the same thing as chem trails or are you suggesting we would find silver and the other types of cloud seeding chemicals in chem trails if so ive still never seen evidence of such claims id appreciate it if you could provide any evidence of such claims its hilarious they us government officials state what they are doing they tell you the are spraying and geo engineering the climate even when they hold congressional hearings telling you what they are doing how they are doing it etc people have such deep rooted stockholm syndrome even when they are being stabbed in the heart they proclaim to feel no pain very sad chemtrails are the answer to climate change that is their excuse also in many countries in the world that a have planes flying in the sky have no chemtrails because they are not apart of this madness china japan australia new zealand russia in these countries chemtrails dont exist its hilarious how folks like you make outrageous claims like congress has admitted to spraying chemtrails but then you can never ever ever point to evidence backing up your assertions ive done my homework here and will continue to seek actual evidence but what i wont do is blindly believe in massive trillion dollar government projects based on a few heavily edited youtube videos id be happy to read congressional testimony if you can link to it but i know that you cannot link to evidence of chemtrails cloud seeding maybe but we all know cloud seeding and rain manipulation is real look up  and watch it happen for yourself  im watching it right now in ma this is global no more cognitive dissonance  no one with   eyes and half a brain can deny  lol when i look up and see contrails i dont immediately think im being poisoned by a vast multi trillion dollar global conspiracy involving every level of government as well as the private sector and somehow kept secret for decades by a cabal of lizard people who are pulling the strings of government i see water vapor and then get back to work youre either a moron a paid moron  or actually truly ignoranteither or  so when i see clouds im supposed to be scared help me out oh just go back and watch the telievision you are cooked the television what does that have to do with the science of con trails or chem trails he should consult with peter kirby and g edward griffin what in the world are they spraying and michael jmurphy why in the world are they spraying arizona sky watch amongst others an excellent film very useful in instilling doubts in honest deniers  it helps to discover an insane reality this film was made for nonbelievers most of persons

3,facebook banking on a cashless societybrandon turbeville essentially the new application which is currently in beta phase with the commonwealth bank of australia allows for interactions regarding banking and financial services over alleged secure and private connections a similar albeit attenuated program is already in existence in india which was created by icici bank in conjunction with facebook that allows users through a secure ssl connection to view account details and mini statements as well as apply for debit cards and request chequebooks see the icici bank facebook app demo video here indeed keypoint credit union also has its own facebook app that allows for many of the same features including the users ability to access all of their keypoint accounts via the app facebook is obviously known for many things but none of them are its respect for privacy in fact facebook ceo mark zuckerberg has been very open about his disdain for even the concept of privacy stating openly that he simply doesnt believe in it with this in mind and given the track record as well as the open declarations of disregard for privacy by facebook and its directors would anyone in their right minds trust their online banking and financial information to the social networking giant unfortunately the answer is likely to be a resounding yes regardless of the stampede toward yet another privacy destroying program ana kasparian of the young turks accurately summed up some of the concerns regarding online banking privacy and the new facebook app during a recent tyt broadcast she said and ill tell you what my conspiracy theory is facebook makes money by selling ads and the way that they sell ads is by telling the advertisers what their users are spending their money on if they have the ability to see what youre spending your money on via billpay on their website then theyre going to sell that information to a third party and then theyre going to be like what what privacy what are you talking about kasparian should give herself more credit her deductions are merely logic based on previous experiences and the historical behavior of facebook not conspiracy theories in keeping with the concerns regarding privacy however it is clear that these ridiculous apps will no doubt be able to be accessed via smartphones in addition to personal computers and will therefore be subject to even more hacking possibilities indeed the increasing number of apps and remote smartphone related programs dealing with personal financial banking and payment information will undoubtedly produce an increase in the number of hacking and identity theft incidents thus the public that was so easily enticed to use these programs under the guise of convenience will be calling for an increased level of security to reduce the ability of hackers to access the data they freely offered online once their poorly thought out decisions come back to bite them enter biometrics the only sure way to protect against theft and hacking unfortunately however such concerns as those expressed by kasparian are almost guaranteed to go unheeded if they are even addressed by facebook or the respective participating banking institutions it will only be discussed as a public relations move designed to placate those on the fence and the holdouts who will themselves be caught up in the dragnet in a matter of just a few years in the end the new facebook banking app is just one more step toward the ultimate goal of the cashless society and the requirement that even the most personal individual information such as iris scans fingerprints vein scans facial photographs and even dna swabs be surrendered for the purpose of data security as i have stated on many occasions these types of programs are always introduced under the guise of convenience then as more and more people take the bait the older methods of payment are seen as cumbersome and eventually are phased out completely mandates then replace what was once a personal choice yet what is so ironic about the facebook banking app is that while the program is touted as providing so much more convenience even when putting privacy and cashless society issues aside and with the program running at its optimum the app really isnt that much more convenient as one commenter on the tyt video quoted above wrote you can already do online banking at the same time as facebook its called opening a second tab you morons read other articles by brandon turbeville here linkwithintextrelated articles

1,teen climate activist greta thunberg believes that she may have contracted coronavirus and has been self isolating at home with her father actor svante thunberg  thunberg says that they both started having symptoms after a recent train tour of europe together and have both been in isolation for the last couple of weeks  the mail online reports they were travelling in europe before lockdowns were imposed by many governments across the continent in a bid to halt the spread of the virus  in an instagram post today thunberg said she suffered shivers a sore throat a cough and felt tired after travelling with her father from brussels  the swedish   year old said in a video published by the new scientist today that her father had more intense symptoms such as a fever and that she has now recovered  she said for the last two weeks i have been isolated and then i got the virus  i came home from central europe and then i isolated myself from the beginning because i thought i might as well as ive been on trainsand so i dont want to put anyone else at risk  but then i started feeling some symptoms after a few days but the important thing is that i didnt basically feel that ill  at the same time my father was feeling much more intense symptoms  thunberg said in her instagram post that she self isolated in an apartment away from her sister and mother after noticing symptoms   days ago  she added that she wanted to raise awareness about how easy it was to transmit the infection without realising  the campaigner said i didnt basically feel that i was ill it could be that i was feeling unusually tired i was coughing a bit  that is because im not in a risk group i didnt get it very seriously that also is very dangerous because you dont know you have it  if i wouldnt have been for my father getting it at the same time and much more intense than me i might not even have noticed it that i was sick  many people dont feel symptoms at all or very mild symptoms but it can be contagious  that is something i want to communicate that many people dont feel symptoms at all or very mild symptoms but it can still be contagious so you have to really practice social distancing whether you feel ill or not  on social media the teenager called on young people to protect groups at greater risk from the disease  thunberg went on to explain that in sweden patients cannot get tested for covid   unless hospital treatment is needed  she added so of course im not   per cent sure i have got it but it would have been very strange if it would have been something else because it just fits very especially with my fathers reaction its exactly fitting with the symptoms
3,why we all should be concerned over citizen rankings and how scores are calculatedby kristan t harris eventually we maysee citizen rankings become more prominent and even dictate if you can fly leave the country access government buildings shoot a smart gunreceive a job healthcare coverage you will receive entera self driving carand even what school your children may attend socially the speculative reality is that a citizen score would gather data from social media sites such as facebook reddit twitter snapchat and instagram facebook which reads likea public diary already records your conversations and reports controversial activity to local police the system would undoubtedlycalculate a scorebased on your friends political postings arguments and relationships if you recently had conversations about suicide or owning firearms expect your threat rating to increase dating sites are no exception to metadata collection websites such as ok cupid ask a plethora of bizarre questions ranging from fringe political ideology drug usage and relationship questions tinder is also starting to rank their clients using their system to calculate your attractiveness or charm factor your school records will beaccessible to the cause under the governments new common core curriculum all sorts of metadata is collected on your children and will eventually be used to asses their healthcare coverage thought processthreat ranking sociability and potential to contribute to society this ranking could be used by a judge to dictate what kind of sentence your child should receive for a crime or by a college to be the deciding factor if your child isadmitted to the school for education credit card purchases online and offlinewillplay a huge factor in calculating your score your purchase history tells the government law enforcement and anyone who has access to this data your state of healthwhat weapons you ownplaces you like to frequent your religious beliefs and your current traveling trends moral of the story is use cash as much as possible and learn to keep it out of the bank your internet search historyis not hands off your search historymay reveal themostpersonal andintimate details of your privateday to day routines includingyour interests shopping trends political affiliationand thought process vehicles will also help contribute to the meta data collection to figure out if youre a   star citizen all new cars have black boxes now that can connectto built in wifi systems that all roads lights and cars will share and communicate with in the near futureand be sold tomake way for driverless cars a citizen ranking would make it easy for a driverless car to dictate who will have to die in an automobile accident due to weather conditions or vehicle malfunction it has already been announced that self driving cars will decide whether you die or not childrenwould naturally receive a higher ranking as well as government officials and law enforcement these rankings are needed for artificial intelligence to properly identify and interact with humans who would of thought that the patriot act would lead to all of this kristan t harris writes for therundownlivecom maybe ms harris was too young to remember this but anyone who thought the patriot act would actually come to this was called a doomsayer nut job or worse yes quite a few people accurately predicted this slippery slope were now sliding down worry not though the citizen score scam will have about as much relevance to reality as the credit score scam  just another control game best dealt with by not playing drive an old car dont cook your brain with a cellphone stop playing facebook drone jockey and pretty soon youll fall off their radar and cease to exist because youre not worth noticing thats right where you want to be not really when we go cashless and we will eventually go cashless you will be turned off and have no access to a job food shelter basic services etc yeah they might not be able to find you but you wont live for long at least not in any way that resembles modern life thats not how i see it playing out but if you choose to accept that kind of defeat that is what you will experience many working people got into personal financial debt by playing the credit score game which several bankers told me was nothing but a scam to get everyone to pay their bills on time and be good citizen doobees the only way to win a con game is not to play they cannot force you to play you go into it willingly by accepting defeat before the game starts just as you are doing now earth is a free will planet and when you start exercising your free will you are free simplistic or simple its whatever you choose to make it when and how did you learn to live off of air and sunshine i do not accept defeat but opting out will only lead to being cut offout and therefore powerless the lesson now is the same as it was for the protesters of the  s you can not change the establishment by standing outside of it and throwing rocks engagement is the only way you are just repackaging learys turn on tune in and drop out it didnt work then and it wont work now actually the  s was a gas looks like we came away with different perspectives on that era and opting out is a form of engagement lots of guys ran to canada during the war because they refused to be drafted into war they didnt believe in some people still call them cowards i call them heroes thats what i learned in the  s this is why im voting for rand paul people just dont seem to get this concepteven though they shot one of those oregon guys in the head with his hands up in the air murdered him in cold bloodand where is a picture of that bullet ridden car when they claimed they only shot   times probably in some body shop having all the holes filled when obama armed all the agencies i knew we would be in martial law eventuallyand none of the candidates are talking about taking arms away from those agencies and that worries me i think rand paul would obviously do it because of statements like this but what about cruz or trumpsomehow i doubt they would trump even defends nsa spying on everybodyand what would be the purpose of that sounds like tyranny to me we should be profiling not looking for a needle in a haystack totalitarianism pure and simple the citizens have already applied threat scores on public and private actors using reality rather than virtual reality as its source we are way ahead nowhere in the link for driverless cars deciding who will die does it even mention driverless cars let alone anything about them deciding who will die disappointing kristen harris selfnews post

1,donald trump most likely will not be elected president still his historic campaign has sent shock waves through the american body politic all are asking what it means and what it portends the focus is on america at home rather than abroad foreign policy issues have been overshadowed by anxious domestic concerns   moreover trump never formulated a coherent view of international issues like the average guy he simply spat out whatever thoughts passed through his head as he had caught snippets of fox news any attempt to discern logic and strategy from trumps disjointed exclamations proves frustrating republican presidential nominee donald trump   trumps entire campaign conveyed emotions rather than considered thoughts it played to the publics feelings  amplifying them and channeling them into a turbid or opaque brew of primitive slogans energy was imparted through unbridled vehemence and the showmanship of the born despot   so it is those emotions that we should look at to see what is simmering behind the formal faade of our democracy in action for they will outlast the election therein lies their significance for possible effects on the united states relations with the rest of the world   if there is an appropriate label to stick on this fermenting vat it is nativism by that we mean a rather inchoate mix of atavistic nationalism xenophobia aggressiveness righteous religiosity and racism dressed up as patriotism deep seated sense of grievance and pervasive feelings that the true american has been sold out provide the fuel

1,with just days left before americans will go to the polls to elect a new president voters committed to continuing to live under the protections of personal liberty in the constitution must examine positions taken by the candidates on key issues   in this article well look at hillary clintons call for civilian disarmament and what americans could do to prevent this policy from coming to pass even if clinton is sworn in as the  th president of the united states   on her campaign website clinton makes several unconstitutional promises that would have the effect of disarming millions of americans and threatening the enjoyment of the right to keep and bear arms of millions more heres a sample from her list of presidential promises   as president hillary will   expand background checks to more gun sales  including by closing the gun show and internet sales loopholes  and strengthen the background check system by getting rid of the so called charleston loophole   take on the gun lobby by removing the industrys sweeping legal protection for illegal and irresponsible actions which makes it almost impossible for people to hold them accountable and revoking licenses from dealers who break the law   keep guns out of the hands of domestic abusers other violent criminals and the severely mentally ill by supporting laws that stop domestic abusers from buying and owning guns making it a federal crime for someone to intentionally buy a gun for a person prohibited from owning one and closing the loopholes that allow people suffering from severe mental illness to purchase and own guns she will also support work to keep military style weapons off our streets   there are so many constitutionally repugnant statements in these three paragraphs   first there is no such thing as a gun show loophole heres the truth as explained by the libertarian leaning cato institute   if the voters learn the facts about gun shows they will discover that there is no gun show loophole no gun show crime problem and no reason to adopt federal legislation whose main effect would be to infringe on first and second amendment rights   despite what some media commentators have claimed existing gun laws apply just as much to gun shows as they do to any other place where guns are sold since   persons selling firearms have been required to obtain a federal firearms license if a dealer sells a gun from a storefront from a room in his home or from a table at a gun show the rules are exactly the same he can get authorization from the fbi for the sale only after the fbi runs its instant background check which often takes days to complete as a result firearms are the most severely regulated consumer product in the united states  the only product for which fbi permission is required for every single sale   surely clinton and her advisors are aware of this fact and that they are misrepresenting the situation to uninformed voters thus their insistence on closing the gun show loophole becomes nothing less than another attempt to demand the surrender of natural rights in exchange for a safer world
1,when fbi director james comey announced on july   that the department of justice would not seek the indictment of hillary clinton for failure to safeguard state secrets related to her email use while she was secretary of state he both jumped the gun and set in motion a series of events that surely he did not intend was his hand forced by the behavior of fbi agents who wouldnt take no for an answer did he let the fbi become a political tool   here is the back story   the fbi began investigating the clinton email scandal in the spring of   when the new york times revealed clintons use of a private email address for her official governmental work and the fact that she did not preserve the emails on state department servers contrary to federal law after an initial collection of evidence and a round of interviews agents and senior managers gathered in the summer of   to discuss how to proceed it was obvious to all that a prima facie case could be made for espionage theft of government property and obstruction of justice charges the consensus was to proceed with a formal criminal investigation   six months later the senior fbi agent in charge of that investigation resigned from the case and retired from the fbi because he felt the case was going sideways thats law enforcement jargon for nowhere by design john giacalone had been the chief of the new york city philadelphia and washington dc field offices of the fbi and at the time of his sideways comment was the chief of the fbi national security branch   the reason for the sideways comment must have been giacalones realization that doj and fbi senior management had decided that the investigation would not work in tandem with a federal grand jury that is nearly fatal to any government criminal case in criminal cases the fbi and the doj cannot issue subpoenas for testimony or for tangible things only grand juries can   giacalone knew that without a grand jury the fbi would be toothless as it would have no subpoena power he also knew that without a grand jury the fbi would have a hard time persuading any federal judge to issue search warrants

3,traits of an awakening soulchristina sarich   being in public places is sometimes overwhelming since our walls between self and other are dissolving we havent really learned to distinguish between someone elses energy and our own if the general mood of the crowd is herd like or negative we can feel this acutely and may feel like retreating into our own private space when we have recharged our batteries with meditation spending time in nature far away from other people or just sitting in quiet contemplation we are ready to be with the masses again in personal relationships we often will feel someone elses emotions as our own it is important to have this higher sense of empathy but we must learn to allow another persons emotions while observing them and keeping our empathy but realizing that not all emotions belong to us social influence can dampen our own innate wisdom   we know things without having to intellectually figure them out often called intuitive awareness we have a ha moments and insights that can explain some of the most complex theories or phenomenon in the world some of the most brilliant minds of our time just know adepts and sages often were given downloads of information from higher states of consciousness after meditating or being in the presence of a more conscious individual this is happening for more people with more frequency as we trust our intuition more often it grows stronger this is a time of thinking with our hearts more than our heads our guts will no longer be ignored our dreams are becoming precognitive and eventually our conscious thoughts will be as well   lying to us is nearly impossible we may not know exactly what truth you are withholding but we can also tell with our developing intuition and esp skills that something isnt right we also know when you have other emotions pain love etc that you arent expressing youre an open book to us we arent trained in counter intelligence we are just observant and knowing while we may pick up on physical cues we can look into your eyes and know what you are feeling   we may pick up symptoms of your cold just like men who get morning sickness when their wives are pregnant sympathy pains whether emotional or physical are something we experience often we tend to absorb emotion through the solar plexus considered the place we stomach emotion so as we learn to strengthen this chakra center we may sometimes develop digestive issues grounding to the earth can help to re establish our emotional center walking barefoot is a great way to re ground   we tend to root for the underdog those without voices those who have been beaten down by the matrix etc we are very compassionate people and these marginalized individuals often need more love people can sense our loving hearts so complete strangers will often tell us their life stories or approach us with their problems while we dont want to be a dumping ground for everyones issues we are also a good ear for those working through their stuff   if we dont learn how to set proper boundaries we can get tired easily from taking on other peoples emotions energy vampires are drawn to us like flies to paper so we need to be extra vigilant in protecting ourselves at times   unfortunately sensitives or empaths often turn to drug abuse oralcohol to block some of their emotions and to protect themselves from feeling the pain of others   we are all becoming healers we naturally gravitate toward healing fields acupuncture reiki qi gong yoga massage midwivery etc are fields we often find ourselves in we know that the collective needs to be healed and so we try our best to offer healing in whatever form we are most drawn to we also turn away from the traditional forms of healing ourselves preferring natural foods herbs and holistic medicine as ways to cure every ailment   we see the possibilities before others do just like when the church told copernicus he was wrong and he stood by his heliocentric theory we know what the masses refuse to believe our minds are light years ahead   we are creative we sing dance paint invent or write we have amazing imaginations   we require more solitude than the average person   we might get bored easily but we are really good at entertaining ourselves   we have a difficult time doing things we dont want to do or dont really enjoy we really do believe life was meant to be an expression of joy why waste it doing something you hate we arent lazy we are discerning   we are obsessed with bringing the truth to light like little children who say thats not fair we want to right the wrongs of the world and we believe it often just takes education we endeavor to explain the unexplainable and find answers to the deep questions of life we are seekers in the campbellian paradigm the hero with a thousand faces   we cant keep track of time our imaginations often get away with us and a day can feel like a minute a week a day   we abhor routine   we often disagree with authority for obvious reasons   we will often be kind but if you are egotistical or rude we wont spend much time with you or find an excuse to not hang out with people who are obsessed with themselves we dont get people who are insensitive to other peoples feelings or points of view   we may be vegan or vegetarian because we can sense a certain energy of the food we eat like if an animal was slaughtered inhumanely we dont want to consume negative energy   we wear our own emotions on our sleeves and have a hard time pretending to be happy if we arent we avoid confrontation but will quietly go about changing the world in ways you cant even see these   traits of an awakening soul are a reminder of how important it is to maintain awareness clarity and strength in these interesting times if you are experiencing something that is not on this list please add it to the comments section below christina sarich is a musician yogi humanitarian and

4,copyright   the washington post ashkelon israel    as it pushes for international action against irans nuclear program israel is steadily assembling one of the worlds most advanced missile defense systems a multi layered collection of weapons meant to guard against a variety of threats including the shorter range grads used to strike israeli towns like this one and intercontinental rockets the effort partly financed by the united states and incorporating advanced american radar and other technology has been progressing quietly for two decades but israeli defense and other analysts say it has now reached a level of maturity that could begin changing the nature of strategic decisions in the region centered on the arrow   anti missile system which has been deployed the project is being extended to include a longer range arrow   the davids sling interceptor designed to hit lower  and slower flying cruise missiles and the iron dome system intended to destroy grads katyushas qassams and other shorter range projectiles fired from the gaza strip and southern lebanon with the arrow system in operation and the iron dome due for deployment next year israel has something to stabilize the situation the knowledge that an attack will fail said uzi rubin a private defense consultant who ran israels missile shield program in the  s iran he said now cannot be assured of a successful first strike against israel while groups such as hamas in gaza and hezbollah in lebanon may find one of their favored tactics undermined advances in irans rocket technology coupled with its ongoing nuclear program are chief concerns of the united states and europe as well as of israel and other middle eastern countries alongside diplomatic efforts to persuade iran to curb its nuclear research missile defense programs have been designed with that country in mind the obama administration decided this week to scrap a bush era plan to deploy a longer range missile defense system in the czech republic and poland and said it would move toward a more intermediate system that better matches its assessment of irans capabilities in israel the issue is considered a top foreign policy priority there have been varying israeli assessments about irans progress toward a nuclear weapon the head of the mossad intelligence agency told a parliament committee over the summer that iran may be five years away from acquiring an atom bomb but the head of military intelligence has said it could happen by the end of this year prime minister benjamin netanyahu meanwhile sees irans program as an imminent danger it is something that threatens israel and threatens the region and threatens the peace of the world he said during a recent visit to germany there is not much time a recent unannounced trip by netanyahu to russia was thought by some israeli analysts to be linked to the broad set of issues regarding iran including russias possible sale of advanced antiaircraft missiles to tehran and the likelihood that israel will strike irans nuclear facilities if the united states and europe cannot find another solution but the steady growth of israels missile defenses sheds a different light on the countrys military doctrine and sense of vulnerability defense minister ehud barak said this week that he did not consider irans nuclear program an existential issue because israel is strong part of that strength lies in its nuclear capabilities    never acknowledged but widely presumed to exist    and part in the assumption that the united states would stand behind israel if it came under attack but it also rests in the calculation that enough of the countrys air bases and other military facilities would survive a first strike to retaliate effectively the sort of deterrence    guaranteed retaliation    that the united states and then soviet union once achieved by deploying nuclear warheads in submarines and keeping bombers aloft is what israel is striving for through its antimissile systems iran is radical but radical does not mean irrational rubin the defense consultant said they want to change the world not commit suicide israels program had its origins in the  s and grew out of concern about syrias suspected acquisition of chemical weapons it took on added urgency in the   persian gulf war when nearly   iraqi scud missiles hit the tel aviv area the arrow was deployed in   and israel and the united states have since conducted a joint biennial missile defense exercise called juniper cobra to work on integrating the weapons radars and other systems of the two countries israel for example has the advanced us x band radar stationed in the negev desert israeli defense industry officials say the country also has virtually real time access to some us satellite data an important part of its early warning system the next joint exercise is scheduled for october as concern shifted to the threat of long range missiles from iran    the countries are about   miles apart at the closest point well within the known range of iranian missiles    it also focused on the shorter range weapons that hezbollah and hamas have turned on israel in the past few years the rockets fired by hezbollah at northern israel during the   israel lebanon war led israeli officials to accelerate work on a short range missile defense system as did recent grad strikes against ashkelon a mediterranean city of about    people and the site of major electricity desalinization and other facilities as it stands we have no defenses no shelters no public buildings being protected said alan marcus the citys director of strategic planning and architect of a response plan developed to cope with the about   missile strikes since   what do we do close the beach and tell people there might be a missile attack marcus said beginning next year israeli officials say the iron dome system should provide some relief the mobile launchers initially will be placed around towns and facilities near the gaza strip but they ultimately may be deployed in locations nationwide the system has sparked some controversy it has not for example proved effective against mortar shells and could leave the towns closest to the border areas vulnerable including chief targets such as sderot critics have pushed for other systems including a chemical laser one that israel was jointly developing with the united states or the rapid fire phalanx guns that can be used to protect key facilities such as power plants there is also concern that militant groups could try to overwhelm the system by firing large barrages of comparatively cheap homemade qassams    perhaps not expecting to do damage so much as forcing israel to spend tens of thousands of dollars a shot to knock them down but israeli officials say systems such as iron dome are crucial to the countrys military planning    in terms of preventing damage and diminishing the need to retaliate although many of the rockets fired by hamas and hezbollah land on empty land one of these times one of the qassams will hit a bus and then the government will have to make a decision about how to react said shlomo dror a spokesman for the israel defense forces there is a bigger issue here than how much it costs it is going to give us some answers
4,distributed by the new york times syndicate the quirky charm and sad passing of archaic dictionary entries the oxford english dictionary is in its current book form almost    pages long it represents more than a century of effort on the part of hundreds of learned scholars who have compiled an inventory of all the english words that have been in substantial use since   ad it does a wonderful job of documenting the meaning usage pronunciation and etymology of these words and is a stunning intellectual accomplishment in almost every possible way so it is rather odd to see that the oed defines the word care as some kind of stuff this seems at first glance to be a rather nonspecific definition to find in what is arguably the greatest dictionary ever created but it is actually very specific    just a bit archaic the word stuff has had a variety of meanings through the ages and at the time that this definition was written in   it referred to among other things a woollen fabric or material for the gown worn by a junior counsel one thing not so well known about the oed is that a large portion of it was published between   and   and has hardly been updated since past improvements to the dictionary have primarily focused on adding new entries and senses of words rather than revising the already existing ones that had become out of date now however the entire dictionary is being revised online for the first time ever this current revision began in   the editors have gone from the letter m through the beginning of re  although some words are edited out of sequence enormous changes are being wrought in the dictionary    often through adding information that was not available when the dictionary was first written for instance marriage is defined quite differently today than it was when the entry was initially published a century ago and the oed now specifies that it can refer to a union of persons of the same sex although i am certainly in favor of the oeds improving itself in this fashion i must confess to a touch of sadness when i come across one of the more whimsical definitions or etymologies that have disappeared as progress and lexicographic accuracy inexorably march forward for instance the word murinoid used to be defined as resembling the mouse or its allies    a turn of phrase that always evoked tchaikovskys nutcracker alas ally is an old term of scientific classification and is no longer included in the entry for murinoid for years i was certain that the oeds definition of cretin one of a class of dwarfed and specially deformed idiots found in certain valleys of the alps and elsewhere was indicative of a lexicographers distaste for the inhabitants of the alps but peter gilliver an editor of the oeds revision who is also at work on a history of the dictionary informed me that it was simply an earlier and specialized use of the word idiot and reflected no bias on the part of the creators of the dictionary i asked gilliver if there were parts of the dictionary the editors might feel a twinge of regret over while changing he admitted to a wistful feeling in seeing the etymology for the phrase pope joan after the fabulous female pope joan falling by the wayside i share his sense of loss even as i understand that we no longer often use the word fabulous in the same sense as fabled gilliver also pointed to the word prothodaw which has had its spelling changed to protodaw and lost its definition of a prime simpleton a noodle of the first rank eschewing the pejorative noodle and embracing brevity the oed now defines it as a complete idiot which i find a bit brusque the original definition was the only instance in which the improbable phrase noodle of the first rank was used in this dictionary and now it has gone most likely never to return sadly i expect that when the word boodle is revised it will lose its definition of a stupid noodle i asked irene wotherspoon an editor of the forthcoming historical thesaurus of the oxford english dictionary and a woman who has spent decades reading the oed for her favorite phrases that will likely be changed in the revision she drew my attention to the occasional habit of the oeds editors of writing definitions that lumped together startlingly disparate items like the one for bing which states that it may describe a heap of corn potatoes stones earth or dead bodies the oed is hardly unique in its occasional inclusion of whimsical or outdated entries jesse sheidlower editor at large for the oed points out that the chambers dictionary most recently published in   has managed to retain such gems as eclair a cake long in shape but short in duration and middle aged between youth and old age variously reckoned to suit the reckoner i will continue to mourn the disappearance of such definitions but as a genre they are not so much disappearing as continually re emerging semantic change is every bit as certain as death and taxes and it is inevitable that a hundred years from now there will be entries from the dictionaries of today that are just as head scratching and risible as the definition that samuel johnson playfully provided for monsieur in his great dictionary of      a term of reproach for a frenchman ammon shea is the author of reading the oed one man one year    pages he is currently writing a book

4,president jacob zuma taking a concrete step away from the south african governments previous delays in providing drugs to treat aids and prevent women from infecting their newborns declared tuesday in a national address on world aids day that drug therapy for hiv positive pregnant women and babies would be broadened and start earlier the new policy on pregnant women aimed at ensuring that babies are born healthy is in line with the new treatment guidelines issued by the world health organization just a day before treating infected babies earlier is expected to help south africa one of only four countries where child mortality has worsened since   improve the survival odds of its youngest citizens the alacrity with which the government adopted the health organizations advice and extended access to aids drugs gives substance to zumas break with the views of his predecessor thabo mbeki who during almost a decade in office had questioned whether hiv causes aids and suggested that anti retroviral drugs could be harmful more people are hiv positive here than in any other nation and zuma called on south africans to struggle against aids as they had against apartheid we have no choice but to deploy every effort mobilize every resource and utilize every skill our nation possesses he said the policy changes he announced will expand access to treatment zuma said that by april the government would start treating hiv positive people with tuberculosis earlier when their immune systems are stronger    a step the world health organization said would reduce death rates tuberculosis is the leading killer of south africans with hiv the virus that causes aids and deaths from tuberculosis have more than tripled here since   what does this all mean zuma asked in his address broadcast on public television it means that we will be treating significantly larger numbers of hiv positive patients it means that people will live longer and more fulfilling lives zumas emergence as the first south african president to seize center stage on aids comes with its own subplots just three years ago he admitted while on trial for rape that he knowingly had had sex with a woman infected with hiv without using a condom saying he showered afterwards to minimize his risk of infection though acquitted his words became fodder for cartoonists and critics that tarnished personal record served as a backdrop to his speech tuesday as he rallied his fellow south africans to learn their hiv status promised to get another hiv test himself and urged the nation to use condoms consistently and correctly during every sexual encounter harvard researchers estimated last year that the delay by mbekis government in using anti retroviral drugs to prevent women from infecting their newborns earlier this decade led to the deaths of    babies and that    people died prematurely for lack of treatment despite zumas break with mbeki on aids he has apparently rejected a rising public clamor here even among some of his partys allies for an accounting of mbekis culpability the congress of south african trade unions said monday that mbeki should apologize to the nation for his failures in fighting an epidemic it has described as destroying more lives than any invading army in history the young communist league has demanded that mbeki be prosecuted for genocide business day a newspaper editorialized on nov   that a murder trial and cross examination of witnesses offered the possibility of extracting some truth the prospect of having a bite at understanding the mbeki madness beckons the paper wrote even if legal charges might not ultimately stick mbeki asked in a rare interview with the newspaper the sunday independent published on nov   if he had any regrets about his nine years as president made no mention of aids zuma and his party clearly have no desire to open an inquiry into the governments record on aids zuma was mbekis deputy president until mbeki fired him in   and like virtually all the leaders of the african national congress zuma did not publicly oppose mbeki on aids in an article published tuesday in the star a daily newspaper zuma defended the governments record and said that under past presidents from his party specifically mentioning mbeki the government had put in place strategies to comprehensively deal with hivaids he argued that as the government seeks to do still more we should avoid being drawn into an agenda of blame and recrimination still zumas approach on tuesday    to speak frankly to the nation about each individuals responsibility to prevent the spread of aids by changing his or her sexual behavior and to lay out new policies on life saving treatment    won him wide praise from the advocates who had despaired under mbeki in another significant vote of confidence donald gips the us ambassador to south africa announced that the united states would give south africa   million over the coming two years to help meet the growing demand for antiretroviral drugs that comes on top of the   million the united states was already planning to give south africa in the   fiscal year to fight aids but south africans may best remember zumas speech for his embrace of those who have suffered because of the epidemic or been shunned by society and their families among those listening tuesday at the pretoria show grounds was the daughter of gugu dlamini a woman stoned and stabbed to death in   near durban after she said on the radio that she was hiv positive while mbeki once said he had never known anyone who died of aids zuma offered his sympathy to families looking after sick relatives we wish you strength he said we understand what you are going through to those who have lost their loved ones to the epidemic we share your pain and extend our deepest condolences

1,cnn white house correspondent jim acosta slammed president trumps coronavirus speech on wednesday claiming it smacked of xenophobia  according to acosta because potus referred to covid   as a foreign virus during his oval office address to the nation most americans will view has speech as xenophobic  the other thing chris that we should point out at one point during the address the president referred to the coronavirus as a foreign virus that is interesting because i was talking to sources this evening one of the points that the president wanted to make tonight wanted to get across to americans is that this virus did not start here but that they are dealing with it acosta said  why the president would go as far as to describe it as a foreign virus that is something well also be asking questions about but it should be pointed out that stephen miller who is an immigration hardliner who advises the president is one of the top domestic policy advisers and s was a driving force in writing this speech he continued  i think it is going to come across to a lot of americans as smacking of xenophobia to use that kind of term in this speech  watch
2,white house attacks fox news after they release this incriminating story on obama last year president barack obama angered americans after he made a controversial deal to release five senior taliban terrorists from guantanamo bay in exchange for us soldier bowe bergdahlwithout the approval and support of congress to justify their actions the administration celebrated the return of a solider they claimed was a hero and a man of honor shortly after making media headlines however bergdahls former platoon mates came forward to tell the real story bergdahl was a deserter who was captured after abandoning his post in   now the controversy continues as sources confirm that the pentagon had already determined the bergdahl was a deserter at the time of the exchange although it could not be proved the obama administration had an awareness of bergdahls status before they released the prisoners admiral mike mullen the then chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and military adviser to obama was made aware of the evidence against the captured hero in december of   when he spoke with bergdahls platoon mates in person clearly the obama administration did not think that this information would come to light or they would have been more careful parading bergdahl around like a hero to justify their actions what do you think are you sick of being lied to by the obama administration

2,breaking obama caught rigging the election in november for hillary it appears that president barack obama will stop at nothing to make sure hillary clinton beats donald trump in the presidential election thats not surprise given that the former secretary of state has made it very clear she intends to finish what obama started reports indicate that obama helped clinton immensely this week when his department of justice blocked the investigation into the clinton foundation judicial watch released   pages of emails from the democratic nominee included   that were never released to the state department in one of the emails doug band official for the clinton foundation pushed clinton aides for a job for someone else in the state department he told huma abedin and cheryl mills that personnel had been sending him options no wonder hillary clinton and huma abedin hid emails from the american people the courts and congress judicial watch president tom fitton said in a statement they show the clinton foundation clinton donors and operatives worked with hillary clinton in potential violation of the law according to trump this is just another testament to clintons true character and corruption this is yet more evidence that hillary clinton lacks the judgment character stability and temperament to be within    miles of public power said stephen miller trumps national policy director she views public office as nothing more than a means to personal enrichment and every dollar she takes comes at the expense of the public welfare this latest finding is an unseemly disturbing window into a corrupt office and yet more evidence that hillary clinton has been lying from the beginning and by any reasonable definition attempted to obstruct the investigation of the fbi what do you think of this new information
4,henry m paulson jr the former treasury secretary who led the response of president george w bushs administration to the   financial crisis on thursday endorsed calls for greater scrutiny and regulation of capital markets in testimony to the financial crisis inquiry commission paulson called the regulatory system that he confronted from   to   archaic and outmoded the commission which is examining the cause of the financial crisis that pushed the country into recession has a dec   deadline to report to congress paulson said that when he started as treasury secretary he saw huge gaping holes in the regulatory system and he tried to identify regulatory gaps and revive long stalled reform of the mortgage finance companies fannie mae and freddie mac but paulson admitted most of the toothpaste was out of the tube and there really wasnt the proper regulator apparatus to deal with it the financial reform legislation being debated in the senate would direct regulators to require higher capital and liquidity for financial institutions    a step that paulson endorsed everybody talks about capital but to me the biggest lesson i learned out of all the crisis was the lack of focus by so many market participants and by regulators on the importance of liquidity he told bill thomas the commissions vice chairman as a former chairman and chief executive officer of goldman sachs paulson faced skeptical questions about the so called shadow banking system the network of investment banks insurance companies hedge funds and other institutions that largely went unchecked by a regulatory system designed to focus on deposit taking banks a number of times i have said that i believe that we had excessive complexity in financial products and that as i think about it its very hard to regulate against innovation paulson told phil angelides the chairman of the commission paulson showed little sympathy for the argument that colossal financial companies    which have grown only larger since the crisis    should be broken up the level of concentration where we have   big institutions with   percent of the financial assets this is a dangerous risk he said now i believe these institutions are necessary they perform a valuable role he added that there needs to be better regulation as well as more consistent    and bigger    capital and liquidity requirements but then i come to the conclusion that regulation will never be perfect paulson said there will continue to be failures there have been since the beginning of time since the time weve had capital markets institutions have failed weve had financial crises

3,us declassifies disturbing list of cold war nuclear targetsby joshua krause however the government has always been vague about whether they would intentionally strike civilians for its own sake during a nuclear war we know our government deliberately targeted civilians with nukes during world war two but afterward they tried to distance themselves from those tactics at least publicly behind the scenes however the feds were and probably still are just as enthusiastic about total war tactics as they had ever been we know this with certainty now after the us declassified the air forces list nuclear targets from the cold war for the first time the national archives and records administration has released a detailed list of the united states potential targets for atomic bombers in the event of war with the soviet union showing the number and the variety of targets on its territory as well as in eastern europe and china it lists many targets for systematic destruction in major cities including   in moscow like agricultural equipment and transformers heavy   in leningrad and   in east berlin the targets are referred to as dgzs or designated ground zeros while many are industrial facilities government buildings and the like one for each city is simply designated population the   page document titled atomic weapons requirements study for   is little more than a spreadsheet for nuclear holocaust it was part of the militarys bomb as you go strategy at a time when icbms had yet to be invented air force bombers would be instructed to fly into soviet air space and hit whatever they could depending on the priority of the target this spreadsheet determined that priority for the bombers which included    air fields to prevent the soviets from striking back followed by countless industrial targets afterward the deliberate massacre of civilians would begin what is particularly striking in the sac study is the role of population targeting moscow and its suburbs like the leningrad area included distinct population targets category   not further specified so did all the other cities recorded in the two sets of target lists in other words people as such not specific industrial activities were to be destroyed what the specific locations of these population targets were cannot now be determined the sac study includes the bombing encyclopedia numbers for those targets but the be itself remains classified although under appeal the sac study does not include any explanation for population targeting but it was likely a legacy of earlier air force and army air force thinking about the impact of bombing raids on civilian morale for example in a   air corps tactical school lecture major muir fairchild argued that an attack on a countrys economic structure must be to so reduce the morale of the enemy civilian population through fearof death or injury for themselves or loved ones so that they would prefer our terms of peace to continuing the struggle and that they would force their government to capitulate thinking along those lines continued into the post war period when social scientists studied the possible impact of nuclear bombing on civilian morale at the time the us military was still operating under the same total war doctrine that had guided them from the end of the civil war until world war two if the destruction of the civilian population ever became necessary to win the war then so be it as general curtis lemay so aptly put it after he was asked about the firebombing of japan if the war is shortened by a single day the attack will have served its purpose in other words our military always felt that it was okay to target civilians so long as it led to the swift end of a war and thus fewer casualties for all parties in the long run at least that was their twisted moral justification for slaughtering civilians and its clear that notion was the impetus behind this list of nuclear targets let it never be forgotten that this how our government views warfare to them the ends always justify the means and the moment it becomes necessary to attain victory civilians are indistinguishable from combatants the people running our government pretend to act civilized statesman but they have a lot more common with likes of genghis khan and attila the hun image credit joshua krause is a reporter writer and researcher at the daily sheeple he was born and raised in the bay area and is a freelance writer and author you can follow joshuas reports at facebook or on his personal twitter joshuas website is strange danger not only remember hiroshima and nagasaki in  also remember bagdag in   during george bush iis crusade remember serbia during the  s and the alleged collateral damage in the massacre by bill clinton of the belgrade population with the bombing of water and electrical facilities with no military use remember mi lai in south vietnam in the  s and the bombing of schools in north vietnam in   perpetrated by the john mccains remember the indiscriminate bombing of berlin in   by the end of ww ii but propaganda is more powerful than memories now we are facing russians air strikes in isis controlled areas at markets where what mainly is sold is gasoline and other combustibles for the vehicles of isis relatives and supporters and to warm up the homes of those that feel acceptable living among the terrorist resisting to seek refuge i find it interesting that this was released during natos struggle to maintain control over syria i think this is nato saying it will go all the way if it doesnt get everything it wants so we have advanced technologically but we have all the humanity of a conquering roman legion who consistently put populations to the sword or into slavery yea religion if they ever cared they would build deep underground bunkers for every man jack and girl sally and stock it w food ya know like the deep underground hotels that the gold collar scum made for their chickenshit selves with our hard earned labor that they collect in taxes blowback is from future generations of the defeated it may take   generations for the covert forces to assemble into asymetrical warfare infiltrating critical defense n retaliatory mic systems but its a sure thing history is the witness of course history is slanted to the victor since they write the official history to refute the official version is just slander and revisionist it seems curious that the holocaust plaques went from   million to    million in less than   years gratefully visitors had the common sense to photograph the plaques for historical record the method of execution was also changed from gassing to simply died officially of the victim corpses examined the result was death by typhus not one victim in the stack was gassed wth did the gassing and cremation stop when the allies invaded this comment could get me prison time in germany and god help us  canada

3,new police device in oklahoma underscores need for asset forfeiture reformby tj martinell the state of oklahoma was given a terrible rating by the institute for justice in   for their restrictive civil asset forfeiture laws with the new electronic asset forfeiture device it has actually taken terrible to the next level according to news   the state is paying the devices creator    for the software and scanners as well as nearly   percent of all the seized cash the device is known as erad or electronic recovery and access to data machine the state highway patrol currently has   in their possession often the federal government funds this type of technology although in this case it appears all of the funding came from in state regardless of how law oklahoma law enforcement funded the device there is a simple way to limit its use through reform of state asset forfeiture laws sb  cosponsored by sen kyle loveless r oklahoma city and rep jon echols r oklahoma city would have made the use of this device illegal by requiring a criminal conviction before the state could take private property the bill would have amended oklahoma state law to read as follows any property or thing of value of a person is subject to forfeiture if it is established by clear and convincing evidence that it was acquired by such person during the period of the violation of the uniform controlled dangerous substances act or within a reasonable time after such period and there was no likely source for such property or thing of value other than the violation of the uniform controlled dangerous substances act a party to a forfeiture action under this section shall be entitled to a trial by jury a trial related to a forfeiture action shall be held in a single proceeding with the trial of the related alleged crime unless the defendant moves to bifurcate the trial unfortunately the bill failed to muster so much as a public hearing the bill also contained a loophole allowing asset forfeiture to occur if the cases were handed to the feds and placing it outside of the states jurisdiction it is imperative that oklahomans stop this now while it is still relatively new they must put the pressure on their state lawmakers to introduce a new asset forfeiture reform bill however for it to be effective it must also close the federal loophole and prohibit asset forfeiture in all forms no matter the jurisdiction this kind of highway robbery will not stop here financial incentives will inspire other local law enforcement agencies to get their own erads and it wont just be limited to this one device theyll seek other devices that enable them to take property or money without charging anyone with a crime as technology progresses so will the means by which they steal from ordinary citizens the companies that create these devices will also seek state contracts and fight to preserve the status quo states are rapidly taking notice and passing reforms to halt this abusive practice the state of new mexico enacted a law this year prohibiting the confiscation of property from suspects of a crime until after they are convicted montana passed a significant but less comprehensive reform plan tackling asset forfeiture this year as well shane trejo contributed to this report the people who are having their debit cards depleted should also be subject to having their credit lines opened and then depleted after all the police wouldnt do this to a law abiding citizen so let them pay the banks back for what the police took the police should also have the right to open credit accounts in the victims names buying cars for the police fleet purchase gas and repairs etc this is no worse than raw identity theft why should criminals be alone in seizing assets without a conviction agreed guilty until proven innocent i guess legalized theft when are they going to stop infringing on our freedoms its only goingtostop when we make them stop we steal from you and if youve not done anything wrong you can petition the court to get your legitimate property back the state sanctioned crime syndicate commonly called police is once again demonstrating that the constitution that thing they swore to uphold and lied means nothing to them in the old days the highway men aka robbers used to hide behind masks now they just hide behind badges the laws after they robbed people

1,chinese state media on tuesday have raised the possibility of using an electromagnetic pulse weapon emp against american ships that enter portions of the south china sea  during a panel discussion experts suggested an emp weapon could be an effective deterrent against american ships that enter parts of the area claimed by beijing  breitbartcom reports the timing suggests it was a bit of saber rattling by a communist party nervous about its power and prestige after the wuhan virus disaster but some degree of escalation in the south china sea has long been a concern for the us navy and ships from across the free world  to put it bluntly an emp strike on us warships would involve detonating a small nuclear warhead above them but chinas state run global times threw in some speculation about low energy laser devices to keep their saber from rattling too loudly  to counter us repeated trespasses into chinese territorial waters the chinese military has the option of using new approaches including the deployment of electromagnetic weapons song zhongping a chinese military expert and commentator told the global times on tuesday firing at us warships is not a good choice unless the us fires first and that would result in the start of a china us military conflict song said noting that bumping into us ships might also not be a good counter as lessons have been learned from the black sea bumping incident between the soviet union and us in   but the use of electromagnetic weapons including low energy laser devices could be viable as they can temporarily paralyze us ships weapon and control systems without visible conflict but can send a strong warning according to song electromagnetic weapons can emit electromagnetic waves that can potentially jam electronic devices of target vessels and will not cause casualties military observers said the us accused a chinese destroyer of using lasers on february   on its patrol aircraft near guam even though it was the us aircraft that had initially conducted repeated close in reconnaissance that interrupted the chinese fleets normal navigation and training this is a good example and could be applied more song said  this is almost as dishonest a framing of the february laser incident and others like it as the chinese fairy tale about a us army lab developing the coronavirus the chinese laser attack on a us navy aircraft flying over international waters on february   was unprovoked unprofessional unsafe and a clear violation of both maritime law and safe conduct policies for the region endorsed by beijing  these emp threats were prompted by the most recent series of us freedom of navigation operations fonop in the south china sea which essentially involve sailing through waters claimed by china to demonstrate that international freedom of navigation will be protected the chinese are particularly exercised by the presence of the aircraft carrier uss theodore roosevelt and its strike group in the region and while the global times did not explicitly mention it the uss theodore roosevelts visit to vietnam was deeply troubling to beijing  this is the third time in just a week us warships are known to have trespassed into the south china sea us guided missile destroyer mccampbell on march   trespassed into chinas territorial waters in the xisha islands and amphibious assault ship america and littoral combat ship gabrielle giffords sailed in operations in the south china sea on friday the global times complained  xisha islands is chinas name for the paracel islands which the guided missile destroyer uss mccampbell sailed near on march   vietnam and taiwan both have claims in the paracels the chinese peoples liberation army pla claimed it warned the american ship to leave while the us navy said the ship completed its security and stability operations normally  uss america and uss gabrielle giffords conducted joint operations in the south china sea on friday to test unified command and control and practice tactical maneuvers the ships do not appear to have ventured into the waters claimed by china  by combining americas lethality provided by the navy marine corps team with the speed and maneuverability of a littoral combat ship were forging new ways to operate together in one of the most important regions in the world expeditionary strike group   commander rear adm fred kacher said  the pla pulled a few deliberately provocative maneuvers of its own on monday sending a flight of warplanes across the taiwan strait in a rare night exercise the taiwanese scrambled their own fighters to shadow intercept and disperse the communist warplanes according to taiwans defense ministry  the south china morning post quoted analysts who said beijing wanted to send one of its periodic threats to taiwan while also demonstrating the coronavirus epidemic has not weakened the pla  in addition to enhancing all weather capability of its military fleet the communist warplanes fly by is aimed at sending out the message that it is business as usual with pla war games despite the coronavirus outbreak in mainland china said alexander huang chieh cheng a professor of international affairs and strategic studies at tamkang university in taipei he said the plas night drill was also aimed at testing the response of forces such as the united states and telling them that the mainlands air force can carry out night time combat operations of course it is also aimed at intimidating taiwan huang said  the global times portrayed the night exercise as a warning to taiwan that will become more frequent if secessionist forces remain stubborn and continue their secessionist activities  the chinese state newspaper curiously quoted only taiwanese sources about the incident but slipped in a comment from an unnamed military expert who said mondays flight was unprecedented proof that the pla is fully capable of launching military operations on the island at any time of a day

2,what steve harvey just said about hillary clinton will make your furious actor comedian and television host steve harvey has an immense following but hes losing the respect of many of his fans after endorsing hillary clinton during a recent radio show she has fought for social justice equality and policies that expand civil and economic opportunity out there harvey told his listeners he then went on to applaud clinton for her promises to significant improve conditions for the black community as president you really plan on building on the progress that president obama has made to deliver some real results for a lot of americans including african americans harvey continued and im endorsing you as my candidate for president of the united states and i just think that youre going to just do the right thing for the majority of the people in this country the fact that harvey thinks that obama has made significant progress toward improving this country is one thing but the idea that hillary would continue to build is downright laughable what do you think does harveys endorsement of hillary alter your opinion of him
3,tx cop coaxes friendly dog in order to kill himamanda warren i post things like this not to go along with the tide of americans getting used to it or encourage feelings of terror but to show the true nature of police who indiscriminately shoot and kill dogs why do they do it it goes beyond just because they can one things for certain it is not the fault of the pet owners which can easily be determined from watching thats a faulty repeated narrative that will hopefully exit soon from my fox philly news the dog named maximus appears to be wagging his tail in the video before hes shot according to the officer the dog took an aggressive posture and growled before he shot the dog three times killing him as you can see thats another lie a lie oft repeated in similar shootings interestingly you can see two versions of another lie put out by the department offering the reasoning behind the shooting one from my fox philly and one from daily mail neither makes sense and neither helps calm the nerves of nearby residents also notable daily mail reports that the dog owner and the original   caller have moved out of the neighborhood the officer is now under investigation police state usa also has a report on the situation quoting the officer report where his justification for the shooting is offered scary thing officers who do this convince themselves of the reasoning and truly believe they are justified in blasting animals away see justice   maximus facebook page for updates protest planned have you ever gone back to find footage only to see it is removed or that the audio is stripped that seems to be happening a lot lately so one hopes that the embedded video above maintains the audio as the true nature of the shooting isnt fully evident without the audio a youtube video i had open for this article now displays the following but police state usa still has theirs up
3,how many of these secret surveillance programs do you know aboutaccording to various publications in the american and foreign media the united states has created a global system of cyber espionage that allows the interception and processing of personal data around the globe in violation of fundamental human rights in   us intelligence agencies successfully finished the development of geo location tracking software that allows the nsa to collect and save more than five billion location records of mobile users around the world on a daily basis and then through a special program labeled co traveler analyze and monitor the movement of certain individuals that could be of interest for washington in addition since   information on social contacts of us citizens their personal data including telephone calls internet logs bank codes insurance data is being processed by intelligence agencies on a regular basis the global electronic intelligence net echelon auscannzukus or five eyes that was established by the us in cooperation with the uk back in   allowed the intelligence agencies of the the untied states the united kingdom canada australia new zealand norway denmark germany turkey and other countries to exchange secret information including the records on their respective citizens yet another secret project codenamed prism established by the nsa and britains government communications headquarters gchq allowed intelligence agencies to establish close partnerships with major it companies back in   including microsoft yahoo google facebook paltalk aol skype youtube and apple such cooperation allows the secret services to read private e mails and monitor the transfer of files throughout global information space this allows the nsa to control sovereign leaders business representatives and foreign diplomats as has been repeatedly reported on by various international media outlets however washington doesnt seem to be satisfied with its progress since it continues funding and developing new secret projects that would not simply allow the united states to retain an effective control over global information space but to influence web users worldwide to its own advantage as well thus the intelligence advanced research projects activity agency iarpa in recent years has started a number of research programs to manipulate social networks programs for analysis of the socio cultural content of language socio cultural content in language scil program is implemented in order to develop algorithms methods and technologies that could enable the intelligence community to supervise the activities of various non governmental organizations that do not agree with the social policies of certain governments the development of this program is dictated by the need to recognize the content of messages transmitted over the internet taking into account linguistic differences and dialects iarpa in close collaboration with the national institute of standards and technology is also developing a program codenamed reynard which aims at studying the phenomena of social dynamics in so called virtual worlds such as mmos this particular study is carried out in the interest of the security agencies in order to assess the political mood of the population and taking proactive measures once it changes the intelligence community is also sponsoring the development of the aladdin program designed for automated analysis and description of video content automated low level analysis and description of diverse intelligence video vace the main goal of this program is to provide intelligence analysts with automated search capabilities to track videos that could be of interest for them videos for analytical processing can come from different sources television surveillance cameras regular pictures interviews or even footage shot by drones the footage is systematized by time and place to identify certain individuals and determine the sequence of their actions which may be in certain semantic relations to present day events currently iarpa implemented a program called babel which aims at developing effective speech recognition software in different languages and dialects washington and its agencies are literally spending billions of taxpayer dollars annually under the convenient guise of the war on terror which in fact turns out to be a hidden war against its own citizens now deprived of basic human rights but what makes it even worse is that its pushing its satellite countries to launch an all out offensive against the civil liberties of europe and beyond vladimir platov middle east expert exclusively for the online magazine new eastern outlook where this first appeared

3,avatars and their behavioral effect on realityby nicholas west just a short while ago more or less yesterday a rise of the robots scenario was being debated for its potential utopian and dystopian outcomes then the movie avatarsupplanted terminatorto reflect an entirely new possibility it didnt take very long the avatar has now arrived and scientists are beginning to study the effects of how virtual reality can impact ones perception of themselves and those around them in the real world early conclusions are troubling the avatar project has very clear milestones as documented on the   website they are as follows a roadmap also illustrates the progression new scientist announced in july of last year a significant step in merging reality with virtual reality the model avatar took the body of a four year old child its was a tentative step as would be the case with any four year old but suggested that the mind can begin to merge with any body it wishes inside the digital landscape  prior research by slaters team shows that when a person acquires a body type they have never experienced social and cultural expectations often influence how they relate to the new body studies are underway to take into account the two way nature of this informationperception transfer concurrently it appears that similar to ones preconceptions in the real world impacting the virtual experience actions taken in the virtual world are being shown to impact the primary reality things we experience in a virtual landscape can also have profound effects on our behaviour in the real world in a separate study by researchers at stanford university in california giving people superhero powers in a virtual environment made them behave in a more helpful manner in real life the researchers say that brain imaging studies would help them to understand the reorganisation that occurs when assimilating a new body the motivation springs from a project looking at how to embody people in child sized robots we thought we ought to look at the consequences of that first says slater a more recent study published in the highest ranked empirical journal in psychology psychological science drew similar conclusions about how the virtual world can impact the real and gives further insight into how easily a player can become programmed this would seem to lend credence to those who assert that violent video games for example can lead to aberrant behavior that models the role one has assumed in the game as the study illustrates one does not necessarily need to identify with the character which would rule out the argument that people with violent tendencies who play violent video games are prone to violent action later with the added immersion of virtual reality this potential is likely amplified our results indicate that just five minutes of role play in virtual environments as either a hero or villain can easily cause people to reward or punish anonymous strangers says lead researcher gunwoo yoon of the university of illinois at urbana champaign as yoon and co author patrick vargas note virtual environments afford people the opportunity to take on identities and experience circumstances that they otherwise cant in real life providing a vehicle for observation imitation and modeling they wondered whether these virtual experiences specifically the experiences of taking on heroic or villainous avatars might carry over into everyday behavior the researchers recruited   undergraduates to participate in two supposedly unrelated studies the participants were randomly assigned to play as superman a heroic avatar voldemort a villainous avatar or a circle a neutral avatar they played a game for   minutes in which they as their avatars were tasked with fighting enemies then in a presumably unrelated study they participated in a blind taste test they were asked to taste and then give either chocolate or chili sauce to a future participant they were told to pour the chosen food item into a plastic dish and that the future participant would consume all of the food provided the results were revealing participants who played as superman poured on average nearly twice as much chocolate as chili sauce for the future participant and they poured significantly more chocolate than those who played as either of the other avatars participants who played as voldemort on the other hand poured out nearly twice as much of the spicy chili sauce than they did chocolate and they poured significantly more chili sauce compared to the other participants a second experiment with   undergraduates confirmed these findings and showed that actually playing as an avatar yielded stronger effects on subsequent behavior than just watching someone else play as the avatar interestingly the degree to which participants actually identified with their avatar didnt seem to play a role these behaviors occur despite modest equivalent levels of self reported identification with heroic and villainous avatars alike yoon and vargas note people are prone to be unaware of the influence of their virtual representations on their behavioral responses the researchers hypothesize that that arousal the degree to which participants are keyed into the game might be an important factor driving the behavioral effects they observed the findings though preliminary may have implications for social behavior the researchers argue in virtual environments people can freely choose avatars that allow them to opt into or opt out of a certain entity group or situation says yoon consumers and practitioners should remember that powerful imitative effects can occur when people put on virtual masks source emphasis added these studies are being done as ray kurzweils vision to merge our bodies and brains with cloud computing via dna nanobots is coming closer to fruition we would do well to consider the intended and unintended consequences much more closely while the divide between real and virtual still remains perceptible related recently by nicholas west updated     nicholas west writes for selfnewspostcom this article can be freely

1,on election day hillary clinton with all her data specialists and poll gurus came up short the morning after they didnt know what hit them  that is the unexpected fact that statistical data and real life dont always coincide people often tell pollsters what they think the pollsters want to hear or what media tells them is the expected answer while clandestinely harboring different opinions that they share only with their family friends and drinking buddies   hillary clinton and the democratic leadership as well as their republican party counterparts represent a well entrenched political system that system is responsive to lobbies or interest groups and not disgruntled citizens what is more none of the countrys political bosses can see beyond this system and how it relates to their own political needs former secretary of state hillary clinton speaking with supporters at a campaign rally in phoenix arizona march     photo by gage skidmore   during the   election campaign that near sightedness led to a fatal misinterpretation that trump represented only hooligans and deplorable people who could not themselves possibly add up to a silent majority thinking along these lines clinton and the overconfident democratic establishment made a perhaps unconscious decision to let this apparent bozo trump lose the election rather than they the democrats going out there and doing what was necessary to win it   for instance they apparently did not bother to design a message to compete for the votes of those listening to trump they did not take into consideration the historically observable fact that millions of americans had over the last   years seemed to give up on politics because they saw the system as unresponsive

3,social justice activists seek equal tyranny for all women to be drafted soonby eric blair i normally avoid these social justice warrior topics because theyre so charged with emotion that very little logic actually makes it into the discussion but yesterday a story about a mens rights group pushed me over the edge and i wont be called a racist or a bigot for trashing them so here it goes perhaps equality a was a noble goal at one point in societys timeline but these groups rightfully upset by bad treatment seem to want to punish those with privilege instead of seeking those same privileges like other misguided groups this mens rights group seeks to have women experience the same violation of rights that they face what violation of rights do males face but females do not you ask the group is suing the government claiming a male only military draft violates constitution the suit was brought by the san diego based national coalition for men nearly three years ago after the military began considering allowing women into combat but was thrown out at the time after the court ruled it wasnt ripe because the combat role of women was then in flux now on appeal the three judge panel heard arguments in pasadena a week after secretary of defense ash carter announced that he was lifting all remaining barriers to women serving in military combat jobs things have changed judge marsha berzon said at one point during tuesdays proceedings right now the position is that all combat jobs are open to women no attorneys for the federal government said the case should still be thrown out arguing in part that because the named plaintiff james lesmeister has registered for the draft the point is moot there is no assertion in the complaint of any injury whatsoever assistant us attorney sonia mcneil said berzon pushed back saying but they do have an assertion of an injury ie we have to register if i were a woman i wouldnt have to register the last major challenge to male only registration came in the   case rostker v goldberg which upheld the male only provision mainly on the grounds that women were not allowed to serve in combat thus even if the lawsuit fails women will probably be forced to register for the military draft in the near future i suppose i should congratulate feminists for achieving equal treatment under the constitution right im the father of three boys who will not be registering for the draft because fuck you you dont own them through government or otherwise they own themselves and they will not fight and die in your corporate wars if i had daughters id feel the same way id feel the same way if i was black brown or a different nationality because the principles here are peace and liberty not someones fleeting definition of equality albert einstein famously said i am not only a pacifist but a militant pacifist im willing to fight for peace nothing will end war unless the people themselves refuse to go to war if we dont have a right to opt out of the military we have no rights they own us whoever controls the government at a given moment gets to use our bodies like playthings no thank you i choose liberty i choose peace final bones to pick with social justice warriors eric blair writes for selfnewspostcom this article may be freely shared with author attribution and source link this is a great article i did some time in the military no combat and it wasnt all bad back then i was out just before it got really nuts but i lost a few friends because i wasnt indoctrinated enough for them i was honest about my position the funny thing was that they entered stuff in my file that would make it hard for me to get back in lmao talk about clueless lol then iraq came around and i knew i didnt have to worry about getting any unwanted phone calls i felt like sending those guys my former friends thank you notes one in a while a father will me ask about advice of branches of the service to go in i say none not one i remember one who didnt really like that answer employers like to see discipline and charity work is good for that i know a guy who met his wife in el salvador while he was doing charity work and he speaks spanish like a native so he is very employable now as a precaution i would tell draft age kids to learn a skill a language writing skills mechanics accounting engineering welding something that would help keep them from becoming cannon fodder if the us government kidnaps them for service business as usual the only good soldier is a dead soldier they will drink from thier own cup you cant start a fire everytime a us soldier dies on the battlefield the family gets   million dollars and the government pays off a   million dollar bond dead peasants insurance or something similar to it for the families and the cost to equip and train the soldiers replacement costs id love to see these blm women drafted into the military yes yes yes god how they hate western christian democratic civilization they just want a supply of rape victims  go research the stats people became awakened and protested in the  s due to the draft maybe the possibility of women being drafted to kill and be killed for the wealthy elites money hungry scam causes will awaken the masses once again and to think the irish women used to bear their boobs and scratch and scream to show their men going into battle what would happen to them if their men lost btw i never want to see a draft again they must be building up for war if they are spewing this word from the bowels of the beast these pretenders will not allow their children to fight selfnews are always claiming that equality is nature i have news for them nature is not an equal opportunity gig example in my back yard i have several red oak live oak and several pecan trees every year they produce hundreds of acorns and pecan nuts from late summer through late autumn they produce various sizes and quality fruits about   never develop some are used as food for the local tree inhabitants about   die on the tree with parasite infestations and the rest are of varying sizes and shapes short and fat or long and skinny there is one constant though plenty of birds and plenty of squirrels populate the trees i take the developed acorns and put them in a disposable cup with plenty of top soil and water and when they are a foot or so tall place them out by the curb within a day they are gone hopefully by someone that continue to plant them again equality cannot exist in any world whenever communism strikes only the elite ruling class live in luxury while the common folks are equal but living in misery someone once said to the effect communism is the equal sharing of misery i dont get excited about communism anymore the ive got mine mentality of the us is a grotesque failure so   you dont get excited about apples   so oranges are a grotesque failure   hrmm   fail logic hats off to you sir   dynamic steps to begin a better world i admire your position most esteemed author of this article but i have one question for you do you realize what will happen to your sons and possibly daughters now if they do not register for the draft i hope you have a plan b tranny  tyranny spread it around can we say agenda   it is the poor and minorities who end up as cannon fodder for the war machine   the quickest path to extinction for those people is to intentionally put the women in harms way if   of the men in any given society are killed in battle there is no reduction in the breeding potential of that society one man can impregnate more than one woman so   if you want your genetic legacy to end in a middle eastern desert by all means support this mindlessness from now until your family tree ends with you finally full equality this tells us the destruction of white society is near complete putting our potential mothers in harms way is the last move in ending our unique in all the world society the white part of the anunnakis experiment is drawing to a close offered the two young girls from the white house and they too follow the bush kids   at last count that will not fit into the uniform of the true american patriots our banks need our children to kill other children to make there children wealthy again

3,gmo golden rice tested on kids without parental consentbeta carotene enhanced gm rice the golden child of biotech is now hampered by a fudged study under ethics scrutiny a gmo study conducted in china but funded by the usda tested unapproved golden rice on children without authorization creating serious violations of ethics rules tufts university researchers admitted that their lead scientist guangwen tang had broken the rules of disclosure in tests on human subjects but maintain that their august   study titled  carotene in golden rice is as good as  carotene in oil at providing vitamin a to childrenremains valid greenpeace china blew the whistle on what it called a scandal over a potentially dangerous product not properly informing the parents of the children used in the study constitutes a clear and serious ethics violations the organization indicated the larger greenpeace organization has played a long term role in opposing the approval and use of golden rice to fight disease in the developing world they and other opponents have long argued that tried and true methods of treating vitamin a deficiency render the biotech solution irrelevant and unnecessary naturecom highlighted an investigation conducted by cctv in china who aired a special documentary program on the scandal emails turned up by reporters showed that a chinese cdc official hid mention of the fact that the golden rice was genetically modified claiming that it was dropped because it was too sensitive to discuss with the parents of the children being fed gmos in the study many parents have since demanded a guarantee that the rice will not affect their childrens health as well as compensation money for the ethics breach if its safe why did they need to deceive us into this a parent angrily asked chinas cctv in their expos critics note that discrepancies remain over the full details of the trial for instance the cdcs investigation revealed that the children ate golden rice just once during the study and not lunch every day during the three week study as the paper states how much golden rice did the children have exactly asks wang zheng a policy researcher at the chinese academy of sciences institute of policy and management in beijing either the researchers are lying about this now or they lied about it in their paper its a serious offence either way emphasis added according to the published study the gm trait in golden rice that produces beta carotene a precursor to vitamin a was produced using heavy water a technique derived from harold ureys development of enriched uranium during the manhattan project harvested from a hydroponic plant system housed in the usda agriculture research service childrens nutrition research center at the baylor college of medicine in houston tx along with tangs research conducted at the hunan province center for disease control and prevention in china was additional research provided by the carotenoids health laboratory usda human nutrition research center on aging at tufts university in boston golden rice has been a hot button issue in genetically modified politics for decades now proponents blame gm opponents for delaying its approval and outlandishly claiming that they have cost lives building upon the long standing claims that golden rice could save a million lives per year prevent blindness and other related pro gm puffery slate accused anti gmo activists of lying to get their way reporting that groups behind the destruction of a trial gm rice field had falsely claimed farmers in the philippines were behind the sabotage biotech watchdogs like gm watch on the other hand have long claimed that the benefits are less than shimmering and that instead its real significance is in expanding the reach of gm agriculture and companies like syngenta who push it in the developing world since   activist michael pollan greenpeace and others have shown that the concentration of beta carotene is not enough to make a life saving or disease preventing difference a problem worsened by the fact thatcooking the rice reduces the vitamin a content by   gm watch explained how golden rice co inventor ingo potrykus acknowledged back in  that greenpeaces argument concerning the ineffective concentrations of beta carotene in the rice amounted to a valid concern and notable flaw i am happy to acknowledge that greenpeace is arguing on a rational basis i also acknowledge that greenpeace has identified a weak point in the strategy of using golden rice for reducing vitamin a deficiency we will know for sure of course only when all the standard biosafety assessments have been performed we need far more data than we have to date emphasis added the current levels of beta carotene produced by the heavy water golden rice would require children to eat between     grams of rice per day or about       of a cup of cooked rice in order to achieve   of the recommended daily allowance even the rockefeller foundation which long funded the development of golden rice and arguably the entire gene revolution that brought genetically modified crops into mainstream use conceded in a letter written by gordon conway in january   that we do not consider golden rice the solution to vitamin a deficiency and noting that the public relations uses of golden rice have gone too far conway writes the industrys advertisements and the media in general seem to forget that it is a research product that needs considerable further development before it will be available to farmers and consumers yet more than a decade after industry proponents tried to knock environmental watchdogs for their critique and delay of golden rice researchers are caught fudging their data and failing to properly inform the parents of the children used in the study that the product was even genetically modified if the benefits for the world are so profound why is there so much to hide related activist post article aaron and

1,pope francis believes that the coronavirus pandemic is one of natures responses to humans ignoring the climate crisis  he has also suggested that people find creative ways of being at home during lockdown saying take care of yourselves for a future that will come  cnn reports in an email interview published wednesday in the tablet and commonwealth magazines the pontiff said the outbreak offered an opportunity to slow down the rate of production and consumption and to learn to understand and contemplate the natural world  we did not respond to the partial catastrophes who now speaks of the fires in australia or remembers that   months ago a boat could cross the north pole because the glaciers had all melted who speaks now of the floods the pope said  i dont know if these are the revenge of nature but they are certainly natures responses he added  the pandemic has radically changed the way the vatican operates with the pope celebrating palm sunday mass in an empty church and the sites normally packed with tourists empty  the   year old pope who has a damaged lung from an infection in his  s has twice tested negative for the novel coronavirus  he is being distanced from anyone who might be carrying the virus takes his meals in his private quarters and uses hand sanitizer before and after meeting any guests the vatican press office said  pope francis also said in the interview he was recovering from his bronchitis and praying even more from his residence in the vatican during this time of great uncertainty
3,death rattle of mainstream media corporate outlets now labeling each other fake newsby claire bernish cnn first published an article citing without including information ostensibly ruinous to president elect donald trumps political career but buzzfeed took that ball and ran publishing documents believed to have originated from an unnamed british intelligence officer and admittedly unsubstantiated and unverified careless reporting by the mainstream press in other words has reached critical mass and known publishers of fake news are now calling each other to task for egregiously vapid journalism buzzfeed posts unverified claims on trump igniting a debate the times headline asserts while going a step further the guardians article is entitled buzzfeed publishes unsubstantiated trump report raising ethics questions cnn first reported on the dossier allegedly obtained from the unnamed british intelligence official but left out the more lurid and revealing details from the   pages buzzfeed editor in chief ben smith later decided were fair game for publication despite serious reason to doubt the allegations buzzfeed reported tuesday the dossier which is a collection of memos written over a period of months includes specific unverified and potentially unverifiable allegations of contact between trump aides and russian operatives and graphic claims of sexual acts documented by the russians buzzfeed news reporters in the us and europe have been investigating various alleged facts in the dossier but have not verified or falsified them cnn reported tuesday that a two page synopsis of the report was given to president obama and trump mainstream outlets scrambled over each other to ride the viral wave when buzzfeeds article garnered over one million views in short succession and    million less than   hours later but none of those organizations bothered to restrain themselves in the interest of investigating the dossier further incidentally the times was among them and in its scathing critique curiously notes the reports by cnn and buzzfeed sent other news organizations including the new york times and the washington post scrambling to publish their own articles some of which included generalized descriptions of the unverified allegations about mr trump by late tuesday though only buzzfeed had published the full document as if reporting on unsubstantiated claims without providing the documents youre citing somehow excuses the times capricious abandonment of journalistic due diligence nevertheless the article contends of particular interest was the use of unsubstantiated information from anonymous sources a practice that fueled some of the so called fake news false rumors passed off as legitimate journalism that proliferated during the presidential election again the times reported on the exact information buzzfeed did but didnt provide the contentious document for the public to evaluate so in essence its accusing itself in the mix according to each outlet either parroting another or making its own assertion the   pages had been passed around behind the scenes in both the media and intelligence communities that fact alone if indeed true which would be hard to glean from this imprudent crowd raises questions on the decision to publish so close to inauguration day in addition that intel officials have indeed had possession of the dossier but have yet to verify its contents sufficiently to provide comment to the press intimates the striking potential the documents are inauthentic or the information isnt accurate cnn might have held back from publishing those pages but its article contained the equally dubious claims some of the memos were circulating as far back as last summer what has changed since then is that us intelligence agencies have now checked out the former british intelligence operative and his vast network throughout europe and find him and his sources to be credible enough to include some of the information in the presentations to the president and president elect a few days ago buzzfeed in what might come to be an act of journalistic suicide said to hell with it took cnns report as a cue and ran the laughably flawed document admitting at the time that by doing so it was essentially publishing fake news and now the new york times and other corporate press seem to believe eschewing the blame for contributing to the mess under the pretense of plausible deniability for refusing to publish the actual dossier to back their allegations is as simple as publicly castigating the original outlets they copied glenn greenwald adroitly summarized this media shit show writing for the intercept all of these toxic ingredients were on full display yesterday as the deep state unleashed its tawdriest and most aggressive assault yet on trump vesting credibility in and then causing the public disclosure of a completely unvetted and unverified document compiled by a paid anonymous operative while he was working for both gop and democratic opponents of trump accusing trump of a wide range of crimes corrupt acts and salacious private conduct the reaction to all of this illustrates that while the trump presidency poses grave dangers so too do those who are increasingly unhinged in their flailing slapdash and destructive attempts to undermine it hell bent on pinning blame for its own journalistic failures throughout the election cycle corporate media began targeting alternative outlets as fake news and russian propaganda for its stellar reporting on the contents of leaked documents deleterious to hillary clinton but because the mainstream press constitutes little more than a mouthpiece for the us political establishment independent journalists aware of this nonsense have continually called out the errant and viral reports from outlets like the times cnn and washington post indeed the backlash over falsely labeling independent reporting fake news has been so intense the outlet that championed and initiated the use of that term the post came forward this week to pompously declare its retirement indisputably however and particularly as the american public watches this unseemly and mortifying abandonment of journalistic integrity play out mainstream media is now little more than a picked over carcass of its former self to believe anything a corporate press this errant and devoid of the standards principles and rectitude its roots were founded on unless purely for entertainments sake would plainly be foolhardy garnering reliable information from mainstream presstitutes is like agreeing to play russian roulette with facts its time to admit the patently obvious mainstream media is dead claire bernish writes for thefreethoughtprojectcom where this article first appeared image credit lol the seeds of destruction have been sown   is the year the illusions fall apart if all this fake news baloney is the thing that finally convinces the idiot class that the old media is more full of bs than the stockyards it will all be worth it although in the meantime im tempted to shut off my electricity and stay

2,megyn kelly shocks fans with major announcement video fox news megyn kelly and republican candidate donald trump have been going head to head for some time now the feud stems from the first republican debate in august   when kelly asked trump what he later deemed to be overly personal and unfair questions now kelly is going after fellow fox news star bill oreilly arguing that he should have defended her more her comment followed an interview of trump on the oreilly factor i do wish that oreilly had defended me more in his interview with trump she commented i would have defended him more honestly people think im fearless but im human i was not looking forward to going out on that stage and dealing with trump if he was going to attack me kelly added that she felt the pressure of that and the stress of that but ultimately decided to tackle the situation head on she also criticized trump for skipping the event the result in iowa to the extent it damaged trumps fortunes as trump believes it did will hopefully serve as a lesson to other politicians that they bully the media at their own peril kelly stated ive been thinking about the margaret thatcher quote where she said something i love when they attack me personally because it means they dont have a political argument left now trump has declined to take the stage at the upcoming debate in salt lake city and kasich will also not be appearing that means that the event slotted for next monday has been canceled what do you think of kellys comments
3,stasi puts halt on raw milk bill in nevadabrad jordan the fda usda and the monopolistic dairy processors they prop up rejoiced after a raw milk bill was defeated in nevada earlier this month thanks to governor sandovals veto june   the people of that state will be deprived of one of natures most nourishing foods after receiving overwhelming support with a     vote in the house and     in the senate the governor still decided he had to red light the bill to understand why this would happen one must follow da money all it takes is a little pressure from the bigger big brother federal government and most politicians crumble just like the spineless sandoval did the governor said the us food and drug administration fda the american medical association ama and his own state health official agreed that assembly bill   presents significant public health risks the only problem the bill presents is to the dairy processors who want a cheap raw product to add value to pasteurize and profit from isnt nevada the state where prostitution and gambling are legal this guy is afraid of raw milk but not all of the diseases caused by casual sexual encounters hes not worried about the publics health no hes worried he might make the fda mad or more importantly their string pullers the agencies that limit your choice the fda and ama are two of the slimiest agencies in government the ama which has looked to cartelize the health industry for the last   years doesnt want people to find out food can be their medicine because if they did doctors wouldnt be in such high demand why would they do that you might be asking well food processors dairy processors included dont want to be cut out of the equation they want the government to guarantee their jobs as middlemen in the guise of food safety they own the health boards and regulatory boards get subsidies from the government and plan your diet you dont decide what to eat they do and they dont want any dissenters saying their food is bad even if it is its fascism plain and simple mussolini would be proud these processors dont want you or their competition to have freedom of speech food freedom or freedom in general the plutocrats in dc tow the line happily knowing their coffers will be stuffed with money from big food come election time your corporate overlords want you to be good tax slaves that do what they say eat what they tell you and never question the propaganda theyre spreading who are these bastards you might be asking oh you know pepsi kelloggs nestle dean foods etc pretty much any big name brand you can think of thats in the mega lo marts of the world today and these same companies lobby the fda and other government agencies to keep their food oligarchy going speaking of the fda theyre responsible for more than    deaths per year thats right more than    people die each year from the pharmaceutical drugs the fda rubberstamps as safe so governor youre telling me you trust these agencies to tell the truth about raw milk the fda has more hits under their belt than former iraq president saddam hussein and you want me to trust what they say time to step forward no thanks raw milk is a pure whole healing food that has been trusted for thousands of years across the globe when cows spend their lives on sunny pastures where the grass is bountiful theres no need to pasteurize their milk and kill all the beneficial bacteria its been through exhaustive studies and science is on our side its safe and even if it werent i dont need the government telling me what i can or cannot eat as my   month old daughter says nuf is enough we need someone to come forward in these agencies just like edward snowden did in the nsa we need someone in the fda with snowdens guts and courage to alert the american people to the unholy alliance controlling our food supply sound the alarm raise the red flag government is the one stealing your liberty it tells you what to eat what to read in government prisons i mean schools and now knows when youre even thinking about something they dont want you thinking about envision the nsa watching each word you type and delete as you compose a blog post or email america is the new berlin fitted with a state of the art spying agency that makes the communist stasis look like chumps who in these corrupt anti freedom organizations like the fda and ama is going to step forward and admit theyre part of a fascist cause to undermine the free markets and limit consumer choice its not about safety never has been forget the idea of safety because government couldnt care less about it the oh so caring fda approves drugs that have killed more than a million people its not about safety its about control government doesnt want you to find out what parts of your lives theyre controlling though it just wants you to be good serfs if you challenge what the plutocrats say then its lock up time or youll just disappear just ask bradley manning he exposed the government for murdering innocent people in iraq did he receive a medal of honor for bringing this story to the light of day no he was thrown in a cage solitary confinement style and now edward snowden has gone missing in hong kong and farmers are facing jail time for selling milk i mean what is going on ask james stewart from rawesome foods how loving and caring your benevolent government is uniformed gang members from americas mafia kicked in his doors destroyed his food and threw him in a cage for what selling real food thats what oh no the horror of selling real nutrient dense food to people who actually want it if someone wants something especially something good for him then what the hell is the problem purchasing raw milk is a mutually beneficial agreement between two consenting people hookers gambling and booze are okay but raw milk is bad has the world gone mad im not saying booze and hookers should be illegal but neither should as they call it in the underground white gold i want answers sandoval what about mark baker from bakers green acres state officials embargoed him and his farm for selling feral swine even though none of his pigs have ever been found in the wild which almost brought his way of life to an end this was done by the hands of department of natural resources an unelected group of busybody scum that are supposed to be in charge of wildlife not farm life the food oligarchs are always looking for ways to supersede the elected representatives its just easier to pay off unelected bureaucrats who cant be held responsible for their actions and who stay in power term after term saweeet or what about vernon hershberger who was recently acquitted by a jury of his peers for selling raw milk illegally the state wasnt satisfied with the jurys decision they have a thirst for blood and looked to jail him for disobeying an arbitrary holding order from   even after he was acquitted the state is a sore loser and exacts revenge anyway it can whenever anyone steps forward and breaks the law because its morally wrong someone else usually from the government says it doesnt matter whether the law is moral its there for our safety hogwash i say back to them its an illusion a false sense of security theyre not protecting you theyre protecting themselves and their corporate interests if any of the above are guilty of crimes then so is rosa parks and if thats the case america is as far gone as the sheeple who occupy it brad jordan hosts a podcast called food riot radio he and his co host sara burrows work to expose how a collusion between government big agriculture big pharma and big food has determined what ends up on our plates and offer ideas for how to fight back linkwithintextrelated articles

1,for those of us too ensnared in the trumpster fire to pay attention to anything substantive a majorly screwed up thing was happening to our fighting men and women the la times broke the story that the department of defense has been ordering almost    one time national guardsmen from california to pay back enlistment bonuses due to an error over a decade ago horror stories began pouring in of soldiers being notified that they must pay back the money or face wage garnishments tax liens and interest charges   this of course prompted the obama administration to take immediate action while our do nothing republican congress focuses on such important issues as defunding obamacare   defense secretary ash carter announced today that the pentagon will suspend efforts to recoup bonuses overpaid to troops more than a decade ago there is no more important responsibility for the department of defense than keeping faith with our people that means treating them fairly and equitably honoring their service and sacrifice and keeping our word carter added   of course republicans love to wear the biggest flag pins they can find and feign love for the troops come reelection time but really put their words into action this might explain why they did nothing to stop this   it seems the california national guard told the states members of congress two years ago that the pentagon was making every effort at taking back its promised re enlistment bonuses from thousands of soldiers in fact the california national guard went so far as to develop a plan to assuage the problem however being the greedy do nothing leaches that they are the republican led congress didnt lift a finger   once again the obama administration is forced to step in and help the very people republicans claim to love so much

2,find out the ridiculous reason this army sgt was banned from reciting the pledge of allegiance when army staff sgt cory schroeder was first elected as a senator last month for the university of wyoming he was shocked to hear that the pledge of allegiance was not going to be recited before meetings apparently the action was banned because the school did not want to offend international students multiple senators sat me down and said it was a very touchy subject and we dont want to offend anybody claims schroeder who is particular sensitive to the subject after serving in iraq and afghanistan schroder has been debating whether or not to pass a bill that would require the student government to recite the pledge he acknowledges however that it would be a long process and that the liberal standing committee would likely delay any changes what do you think should students be allowed to recite the pledge
4,unbeaten on the racetrack last year rachel alexandra won again monday night defeating her rival zenyatta to take horse racings top prize the eclipse award for horse of the year rachel alexandra received   votes to   for zenyatta two voters abstained and one ballot was voided perhaps no other horse of the year announcement has been as anticipated and never had the outcome been as much in doubt there was little to separate the two horses both females and both victors over males last year neither lost a race in   and both recorded historic feats with the two having never raced against one another it was left to voters to decide who was better or at least more deserving of the sports highest honor members of the national turf writers association employees of the daily racing form and racing secretaries representing tracks that are members of the national thoroughbred racing association make up the electorate the voters might have ultimately leaned toward rachel alexandra because she had the longer campaign winning more races eight to five for zenyatta and defeating males three times as opposed to once for zenyatta rachel alexandra beat top colts in the preakness and the haskell and defeated older horses in the woodward she was the first filly since   to win the preakness the middle leg of the triple crown and the only filly to win the woodward zenyatta did everything she could to wrest the title from rachel alexandra who once appeared to have an insurmountable lead in the horse of the year race after winning her first four starts of the year all in california and in races restricted to fillies and mares zenyatta ended her season with a thrilling victory over males in the   million breeders cup classic at santa anita it was the first win for a female horse in that race rachel alexandra did not compete in the breeders cup because her owner jess jackson does not like synthetic racing surfaces the main track at santa anita has an artificial surface known as pro ride jacksons critics and many zenyatta supporters contended that zenyatta deserved horse of the year because she showed up on one of the sports biggest days and won a race considered pivotal for deciding year end championships the horse of the year announcement came a day after it was reported that zenyatta was coming out of retirement to race this year as a   year old that has led to speculation that rachel alexandra and zenyatta would finally meet the trainer john shirreffs told the daily racing form that zenyatta might make her   debut march   in the santa margarita at santa anita and could race after that april   in the apple blossom at oaklawn because the apple blossom will be run on a dirt track and rachel alexandra is   for   at oaklawn the race could also be on her schedule she is preparing at the fair grounds in new orleans for her   year old debut jackson has yet to decide where she will make her   debut rachel alexandra was a unanimous selection as the champion   year old zenyatta received all but one of the votes cast for older filly or mare champion among the other honorees were lookin at lucky   year old male she be wild   year old filly summer bird   year old male gio ponti turf male and older male informed decision female sprinter kodiak kowboy male sprinter goldikova female turf horse and mixed up steeplechase horse godolphin racing was chosen as the leading owner juddmonte farms as the outstanding breeder julien leparoux as the top jockey christian santiago reyes as the best apprentice jockey and steve asmussen as the outstanding trainer
3,egypt anti terror officer gunned down before testimony against morsibrandon turbeville france   reports that an egyptian security official has stated that mabruk had been involved in drafting the charges against mohammed morsi and the chief of the muslim brotherhood mohammed badie on which the current trials of both are based it is also reported that mabruk was focused on islamist groups that have escalated their attacks since the july   overthrow of president mohamed morsi france   also states that mabruk was set to testify against morsi this week regarding charges that morsi had been working with groups like hamas and hezbollah in his escape from prison during the overthrow of hosni mubarak in   thus islamist organizations like the muslim brotherhood appear to be the prime suspects in what even the interim prime minister hazem al belawi is calling an assassination by treacherous hands still there have been no claims of responsibility for the attack by anyone at this point jihadist organizations have engaged in attacks in cairo on previous occasions including an attack in september that attempted to assassinate interior minister mohammed ibrahim by targeting his convoy ibrahim survived the attack because no groups have claimed responsibility for the attack any further assertions as to who carried it out would be speculation however considering the fact that the muslim brotherhood and sinai militants have been responsible for a variety of violent acts in egypt as of late as well as the fact that mabruk was involved in the investigation and prosecution of morsi and other brotherhood members one may rightly suspect the involvement of one or both of these groups in the latest incident recently by brandon turbeville
3,turning america into a battlefield a blueprint for locking down the nationby john w whitehead it was for this reason that those who established america vested control of the military in a civilian government with a civilian commander in chief they did not want a military government ruled by force rather they opted for a republic bound by the rule of law the us constitution unfortunately with the constitution under constant attack the militarys power influence and authority have grown dramatically even the posse comitatus act of   which makes it a crime for the government to use the military to carry out arrests searches seizure of evidence and other activities normally handled by a civilian police force has been weakened by both barack obama and george w bush who ushered in exemptions allowing troops to deploy domestically and arrest civilians in the wake of alleged terrorist acts now we find ourselves struggling to retain some semblance of freedom in the face of police and law enforcement agencies that look and act like the military and have just as little regard for the fourth amendment laws such as the ndaa that allow the military to arrest and indefinitely detain american citizens and military drills that acclimate the american people to the sight of armored tanks in the streets military encampments in cities and combat aircraft patrolling overhead making matters worse we find out that the military plans to use southwestern states as staging grounds for guerilla warfare drills in which highly trained military troops equipped with all manner of weapons turn american towns and cities in quasi battlefields why as they tell us its so that special operations forces can get realistic military training in hostile territory theyve even got a name for the exercise jade helm   whether or not americans have anything to fear from jade helm   a covert multi agency multi state eight week military training exercise set to take place this summer from july   through sept   remains to be seen insisting that theres nothing to be alarmed about the washington post took great pains to point out that these military exercises on american soil are nothing new for instance there was operation bold alligator in which in which thousands of marines and sailors carried out amphibious exercises against insurgent forces in georgia and floridaoperation robin sage had green beret soldiers engaging in guerrilla warfare in north carolina and operation derna bridge sends marine special forces into parts of south carolina and the national forest yet if americans are uneasy about this summers planned jade helm   military exercises they have every right to be after all havent we been urged time and time again to just trust the government to respect our rights and abide by the rule of law only to find that in fact our rights were being plundered and the constitution disregarded at every turn lets assume for the moment that jade helm   is not a thinly veiled military plot to take over the country lifted straight out of director john frankenheimers   political thriller seven days in may as some fear but is merely a routine exercise for troops albeit a blatantly intimidating flexing of the militarys muscles the problem arises when you start to add jade helm onto the list of other troubling developments that have taken place over the past   years or more the expansion of the military industrial complex and its influence in washington dc the rampant surveillance the corporate funded elections and revolving door between lobbyists and elected officials the militarized police the loss of our freedoms the injustice of the courts the privatized prisons the school lockdowns the roadside strip searches the military drills on domestic soil the fusion centers and the simultaneous fusing of every branch of law enforcement federal state and local the stockpiling of ammunition by various government agencies the active shooter drills that are indistinguishable from actual crises the economy flirting with near collapse etc suddenly the overall picture seems that much more sinister clearly as i point out in my new book battlefield america the war on the american people theres a larger agenda at work here seven years ago the us army war college issued a report calling on the military to be prepared should they need to put down civil unrest within the country summarizing the report investigative journalist chris hedges declared the military must be prepared the document warned for a violent strategic dislocation inside the united states which could be provoked by unforeseen economic collapse purposeful domestic resistance pervasive public health emergencies or loss of functioning political and legal order the widespread civil violence the document said would force the defense establishment to reorient priorities in extremis to defend basic domestic order and human security at what point will all of the governments carefully drawn plans for dealing with civil unrest homegrown terrorism and targeting pre crime become a unified blueprint for locking down the nation for instance whats the rationale behind turning government agencies into military outposts there has been a notable buildup in recent years of swat teams within non security related federal agencies such as department of agriculture the railroad retirement board the tennessee valley authority the office of personnel management the consumer product safety commission the us fish and wildlife service and the education department as of     federal law enforcement agencies employ approximately    armed full time on duty officers with arrest authority four fifths of those officers are under the command of either the department of homeland security dhs or the department of justice whats with all of the government agencies stockpiling hollow point bullets for example why does the department of agriculture need   caliber semiautomatic submachine guns and    rounds of hollow point bullets for that matter why do its agents need ballistic vests and body armor why does the postal service need assorted small arms ammunition why did the dhs purchase    billion rounds of hollow point ammunition along with    fully automatic   x mm nato personal defense weapons plus a huge stash of   round high capacity magazines thats in addition to the fbis request for   million hollow point rounds the department of education irs the social security administration and the national oceanic and atmospheric administration which oversees the national weather service are also among the federal agencies which have taken to purchasing ammunition and weaponry in bulk why is the federal government distributing obscene amounts of military equipment weapons and ammunition to police departments around the country and why is dhs acquiring more than    mine resistant armored protection mrap vehicles only to pass them around to local police departments across the country according to the new york times as president obama ushers in the end of what he called americas long season of war the former tools of combat m   rifles grenade launchers silencers and more are ending up in local police departments often with little public notice during the obama administration according to pentagon data police departments have received tens of thousands of machine guns nearly    ammunition magazines thousands of pieces of camouflage and night vision equipment and hundreds of silencers armored cars and aircraft the equipment has been added to the armories of police departments that already look and act like military units why is the military partnering with local police to conduct training drills around the country and what exactly are they training for in richland south carolina for instance us army special forces participated in joint and secretive exercises and training with local deputies the public was disallowed from obtaining any information about the purpose of the drills other than being told that they might be loud and to not be alarmed the army and dhs also carried out similar drills and maneuvers involving black hawk helicopters in texas florida and other locations throughout the us ostensibly in order to provide local police with realistic urban training what is being done to protect the american populace from the threat of military arms and forces including unarmed drones being used against them policy analysts point to directive no    defense support of civil authorities issued on dec     as justification for the governments use of military force to put down civil unrest within the united states why is fema stockpiling massive quantities of emergency supplies on january     fema made a statement enlisting the service of contractors who could supply medical biohazard disposal capabilities and   yard dumpsters to    tent hospitals across the united states all required on     hour notice this coincides with other medical requests seeking massive amounts of supplies such as     flu vaccinations    each of winter shirts and pants and the same for summer and other goods and services requests as well like tarps manufactured housing units and beverages and why does the tsa need    worth of potassium chlorate a chemical compound often used in explosives why is the pentagon continuing to purchase mass amounts of ammunition while at the same time preparing to destroy more than   billion worth of bullets and missiles that are still viable moreover what is really being done to hold the pentagon accountable for its doctored ledgers fraud waste and mismanagement which has cost the taxpayer trillions of dollars according to reuters the pentagon is the only federal agency that has not complied with a law that requires annual audits of all government departments that means that the    trillion in taxpayer money doled out by congress to the pentagon since   the first year it was supposed to be audited has never been accounted for that sum exceeds the value of chinas economic output given the similarities between the governments live active shooter drill training exercises carried out at schools in shopping malls and on public transit which can and do fool law enforcement officials students teachers and bystanders into thinking its a real crisis how much of what is being passed off as real is in fact being staged by dhs for the benefit of training law enforcement leaving us none the wiser these training exercises come complete with their own set of professionally trained crisis actors playing the parts of shooters bystanders and victims in order to help schools and first responders create realistic drills full scale exercises high fidelity simulations and interactive  d films given that americans are   times more likely to die of foodborne illness than in a terrorist attack why is the government spending trillions of dollars on national security how exactly is the   billion given to various intelligence agencies annually to keep us safe being spent and why is the dhs giving away millions of dollars worth of federal security grants to states that federal intelligence agencies ruled have no specific foreign or domestic terrorism threat why is the government amassing names and information on americans considered to be threats to the nation and what criteria is the government using for this database keep in mind that this personal information is being acquired and kept without warrant or court order its been suggested that in the event of nuclear war the destruction of the us government and the declaration of martial law this main core database which as of   contained some   million names of americans would be used by military officials to locate and round up americans seen as threats to national security a program to be carried about by the army and fema taken individually these questions are alarming enough but put them together and they add up to the kind of trouble that the american founding fathers not only warned against but from which they fought to free themselves indeed when viewed collectively they leave one wondering what exactly the us government is preparing for and whether american citizens shouldnt be preparing as well for that eventuality when our so called government of the people by the people for the people is no longer answerable to we the people in the councils of government we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence whether sought or unsought by the military industrial complex the potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist we must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes we should take nothing for granted only an alert and knowledgeable citizenry can compel the proper meshing of the huge industrial and military machinery of defense with our peaceful methods and goals so that security and liberty may prosper togetherpresident dwight d eisenhower   constitutional attorney and author john w whitehead is founder and president of the rutherford institute where this article

3,police try to buy videos from witnesses after releasing attack dog on families and firing rubber bulletsmadison ruppert contributor usually we see people get arrested brutally beaten or labeled professional agitators for legally filming police activities trying to actually buy the video from the witnesses is at least in my opinion a novel tactic in the ongoing war on accountability the video at the bottom of the post is nothing short of disturbing as it shows police shooting seemingly wildly into a crowd which includes young children and most troubling of all it even shows police releasing a dog which heads straight for a mother and her child the mother was able to react quickly enough to get her child out of harms way but a bystander wasnt so lucky we see the dog clamp down on his arm in the video as he is struggling to break free from the jaws of the police attack dog while officers try to separate them the individuals gathered in order to protest the shooting which they maintain was unjustified of a young man at the hands of police the shooting occurred on saturday around   pm in front of an apartment complex after a foot chase according to orange county sergeant bob dunn quoted by the associated press while the family of the man shot by police as well as neighbors all identified him as manuel diaz dunn could not initially confirm the individuals name however later the above linked story was updated in order to reflect that   year old manuel diaz was identified although there is still an investigation into what actually led the police to kill him the   year old nice of diaz daisy gonzalez informed the orange county register that her uncle probably fled because he had previous negative experiences with law enforcement an angry group of people began yelling and throwing bottles at them while the people did not look all too aggressive they were referred to as an unruly crowd and the scene was described as a near riot from the clips published from eyewitness video we cannot see anything of the sort we only see cops shooting rubber bullets left and right at women and children releasing an attack dog and families fleeing the chaos one person interviewed by kcal   mentioned that they saw a water bottle go flying before the attack began indicating that the throwing of a water bottle might have been what sparked the police action indeed the associated press reports that dunn stated that the entire encounter began when an angry group of people began yelling and throwing bottles at them in an attempt to explain away the attack dog getting out and heading straight for a mother and her child in a stroller before attacking a mans arm dunn claimed that the dog was deployed accidentally update several hours after the original publishing the associated press story above was changed significantly it had previously been at least twice as long as it is now and the mention of just bottles being thrown at police has changed now they report that the killing of diaz sparked a melee in the neighborhood as some threw rocks and bottles at police officers fired rubber bullets and pepper spray to suppress the crowd the mention of the video the mention of the attack dog etc are all mysteriously gone although they added that five people were arrested during the incident personally i see this type of response as indefensible from law enforcement police officers should in no way be justified in firing upon women and children with highly dangerous weaponry because people are throwing bottles and now supposedly rocks as well whatever the rationale might be when you see this response on video it becomes very clear that it is in no way warranted and just goes to show how far gone some members of our law enforcement community already are thankfully there are still some good police officers out there unfortunately since they seem to be getting increasingly rare were seeing these heroes become targets for harassment or in one case even a detainee in a psychiatric ward if we dont do something to show just how reprehensible and unacceptable this behavior truly is we can only expect police insanity if we do nothing all we can do is hope that its only people getting arrested for dancing did i forget anything or miss any errors would you like to make me aware of a story or subject to cover or perhaps you want to bring your writing to a wider audience feel free to contact me at adminendtheliecom with your concerns tips questions original writings insults or just about anything that may strike your fancy related activist post article with additional videos and updates please support our work and help us start to pay contributors by doing your shopping through our amazon link or check out some must have products at our store this article first appeared at end the lie linkwithintextrelated articles
3,us army course authorizes use of deadly force internment camps during us civil disturbancemadison ruppert contributor this likely comes as no surprise to readerswho are familiar with my work on the militarys internmentresettlement operations manual video is also embedded below my coverage of the designation of civilian internee in military literature my coverage of kbrs so called national quick response teams and the fema national responder support camps however this document available here originally published on july   by public intelligence reveals some quite disturbing and clearly institutionalized practices which can and will be used in a time of civil unrest it is important to note that this document specifically states the same operational procedures that apply to the operation of installation confinement facilities see above video and treatment of detainees apply to these temporary facilities except that those policies and procedures establishing training employment mail and correspondence and administrative discipline requirements will not apply however the course cites field manual fm      originally issued in august of   which appears to be the earlier version of the fm      originally published in february of   obviously since this edition of the course is dated april   fm      didnt exist at the time it was written the army will not operate facilities for confinement custody or detention of civilian personnel apprehended for violation of local or state laws as long as civil confinement facilities operated by the department of justice state or local agencies are sufficient to accommodate the number of persons apprehended therefore it appears to be the case that military detention facilities will not be used unless there are not sufficient facilities operated by the doj state or local law enforcement at least we can hope to be thrown in a dangerous filthy and overcrowded civil confinement facility instead of a military internment camp if the military does set up detention facilities these facilities will be operated only until custody of the persons detained can be transferred to and assumed by civil authorities they will not be used for the confinement of persons charged or convicted under civil jurisdiction however this was written long before the national defense authorization act for fiscal year   and the indefinite detention sections included which allow the military to hold americans without charge or trial indefinitely these above guidelines have almost certainly been removed having been given this power when obama signed the ndaa while a judge indeed stepped up against the indefinite detention sections of the ndaa i seriously doubt that this decision would be honored in a time when the military is actually rolled out to quell civil unrest the course is designed for operations inside the continental united states conus or outside the continental united states oconus in cases of civil disturbances when the president is advised by the highest officials of the state that the situation cannot be controlled with nonfederal resources available the control force as these military police groups are referred to in the course is mandated to help restore law and order and to help maintain it until such time as state and local forces can control the situation without federal help in other words there is no restriction in terms of how long these forces can remain in a given area helping restore law and order the course clearly states that these soldiers will not just be used in subduing the disturbance which is what one might expect instead they are actually going to be carrying out law enforcement activities this is incredibly important because while the act of subduing the disturbance would likely be defensible under posse comitatus and the insurrection act it is much harder to defend the military helping to detain those responsible for the disturbance speaking of the fact that the control force may have to actively participate not only in subduing the disturbance but also in helping to detain those responsible for it the course states that control force commanders are authorized and directed to provide such active participation subject to restraints on the use of force it appears that the law enforcement role of the military will be far from negligible seeing as commanders are authorized to use non deadly force to control the disturbance to prevent crimes and to detain persons who have committed crimes but the degree of force used must be not greater than that reasonably necessary under the circumstances of course the degree of forced which is reasonably necessary under the circumstances is usually quite different in the eyes of the police and military compared to how the individuals actually receiving the non deadly force see it one of the most disturbing aspects of this course comes when they are dealing with the use of deadly force some of the policies regarding the use of deadly force which the military will observe are give an order to halt warning shot will not be fired when a firearm is discharged it will be fired with the intent of rendering the persons at whom it is discharged incapable of continuing that activity or course of behavior prompting the individual to shoot shot will be fired only with due regard for the safety of innocent bystanders and in the case of holstered weapons a weapon should not be removed from the holster unless there is a reasonable expectation that use of the weapon may be necessary you read that right there will not be a warning shot at least theyll tell you to halt before they make your face look like a watermelon dropped off a third story roof onto cement the course outlines when deadly force is justified and gives the following circumstances only one of which need be fulfilled however they do state the use of deadly force is authorized only under conditions of extreme necessity and as a last resort when all lesser means have failed or cannot be reasonably be employed the circumstances in which deadly force is justified are a self  defense and defense of others when deadly force reasonably appears to be necessary to protect law enforcement or security personnel who reasonably believe themselves or others to be in imminent danger of death or serious bodily harm b assets involving national security when deadly force reasonably appears necessary to prevent the actual theft or sabotage of assets vital to national security dod assets shall be specifically designated as vital to national security only when their loss damage or compromise would seriously jeopardize the fulfillment of a national defense mission examples include nuclear weapons nuclear command control and communications facilities and designated restricted area as containing strategic operational assets sensitive codes or special access programs c assets no involving sic national security but inherently dangerous to others when deadly force reasonably appears to be necessary to prevent the actual theft or sabotage of resources such as operable weapons or ammunition that are inherently dangerous to others ie assets that in the hands of an unauthorized individual present a substantial potential danger of death or serious bodily harm to others examples include high risk portable and lethal missiles rockets arms ammunition explosives chemical agents and special nuclear material d serious offenses against persons when deadly force reasonably appears necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offense involving violence and threatening death or serious bodily harm examples include murder armed robbery and aggravated assault e arrest or apprehension when deadly force reasonably appears to be necessary to arrest apprehend or prevent the escape of a person who there is probably cause sic to believe has committed an offense of the nature in   through   above it is unclear which offenses this is referring to specifically although it seems that by   and   they might mean enforce the laws of the united states and protect federal property and functions the   and   immediately above this section do not seem to be relevant f escapes when deadly force has been specifically authorized by the heads of the dod components and reasonable appears to be necessary to prevent the escape of a prisoner provided law enforcement or security personnel have probable cause to believe that the escaping prisoner poses a threat of serious bodily harm either to security personnel or others the course delves into significant details even getting into the specific lethal and non lethal weapons to be used and how they will be used the document even describes in detail the weapon carrying positions of safe port arms which another military manual remarked is quite effective when making a show of force in this elevated position bayonets can be seen by participants in the rear of the crowd the sight of bayonets can create an impression of strength and numerical superiority however i guess we can we be thankful that the document states that the danger of intentional or accidental injury to demonstrators or fellow control force personnel prevents such use of rifles with fixed bayonets except with extremely violent crowds the use of bayonets seems to be a mostly psychological weapon in terms of crowd control unless deadly force is being used since they note the primary value of the rifle or the rifle with bayonet attached is the psychological impact on the crowd interestingly it seems that marksmen who will be selected to fire upon americans first will be chosen beforehand in order to groom them for being able to murder their fellow men and women fire by selected marksmen may be necessary under certain circumstances explains the document marksmen should be pre selected trained and thoroughly instructed they may be placed on vehicles in buildings or elsewhere as required the most disturbing description is probably that of full firepower which is described as the most severe measure of force that can be applied by soldiers full firepower is that of available unit firepower with the intent of producing extensive casualties this extreme measure would be used as a last resort only after all other measures have failed or obviously would be impractical and the consequence of failure to completely subdue the crowd would be an imminent overthrow of the government continued mass casualties or similar grievous conditions no stone is left unturned in this document so if you have the time i recommend that you take it to explore all of what is divulged in order to best understand what powers the military already has at their fingertips

administration alleged the who was becoming a tool of chinese propaganda and the president moved to halt funding of the organization  last week the president launched a fresh attack on the organization during a fox news virtual town hall meeting  the world health organisation has been a disaster everything they said was wrong and theyre china centric he stated at the event held last monday  all they do is agree with china whatever china wants to do so our country perhaps foolishly in retrospect has been paying  million a year to the world health organisation and chinas been

pandemic in early january and hoarded medical supplies  the four page report dated may   that was obtained by the associated press notes that china downplayed the virus publicly but increased imports and decreased exports of medical supplies  the document accuses china of covering their tracks by denying there were export restrictions and obfuscating and delaying provision of its trade data  it

regime  it claims that the chinese government silenced its most vocal critics and scrubbed any online scepticism about its handling of the health emergency from the internet  china has roundly come under fire for suppressing the scale of its early outbreak which did not afford other nations time to react before the disease hit their shores  five eyes  the pooling of intelligence by the us uk

rebut disinformation coming from foreign powers  in its report the cross party group also named iran and russia as being responsible for disseminating false information about the covid   virus and

3,the suburbs is america accidentally self organizing into labor campsalex pietrowski the impact it had on my upbringing was profound and quite naturally i developed a keen paranoia about repeating history in any small semblance of this sort of institutionalized incomprehensible terror my family suffered through this and have done their best afterwards to warn us seeing the labor camps ghettos and concentration camps of my nation has permanently altered the way i look at human organization now in the united states i find myself noticing little yet creeping similarities between the way life was organized under totalitarian militarism and the peculiar ways of the self organizing structure of modern urban and suburban america while modern suburbs certainly are not wartime labor camps in any direct terms our modern civilian lives are already physically resembling the organization of prison camps in softer less coercive ways we are naturally dividing and cordoning ourselves off from each other forming suburban blocks and neighborhood units our custom very comfortable and well stocked homes resemble luxury cells that we confine ourselves to growing ever suspicious of even our neighbors in many american neighborhoods you can walk around for an hour and never see another human being outdoors and not in a car increasingly suburban towns are coming under the control of micro bureaucracies neighborhood associations and homeowners associations hoas there seems to also be a rise in the over zealousness of municipal code enforcement in recent years an uncle of mine looked up one day from his front porch to see an armed man in the front yard packing a holstered sidearm this unexpected city employee also had a ruler and was measuring a blade of grass in my uncles yard to determine if it violated city ordinance after years of harassment letters time sucked energy wasted and tax money burned the city finally dropped the    fine they had issued him when in court my uncle asked the city prosecutor the bold question what exactly is the citys definition of a weed they did not have an answer hoas create rules codes and regulations for homeowners voted upon by those few who actually participate enforced by power of contract and backed up oddly by municipal governments and their criminal justice departments infractions of code are punishable by fine property invasions prosecution eviction forfeiture arrest and so on depending on your personal limit for this sort of thing it is ruled by force and humiliation and like camp guards eager to enforce unbendable rules some of your neighbors play out political control fantasies on the boards of these organizations something as benign as deciding to paint your front door red or some other unapproved color can introduce into life a world of stress cost and interference by the masters of the neighborhood hoas are certainly not mandatory which makes them all the more concerning because either people seem to prefer this sort of punitive based micro management in their lives or they dont care not a good sign however you look at it in some areas of the nation such as mckinney texas municipal governments have undergone impressive technical integration with local and federal law enforcement agencies and have even installed centrally controlled public announcement towers to broadcast emergency information and alarms these towers located in neighborhoods around schools and located throughout the town are rather startling if you happen to be taking a nap in your home on a lazy saturday afternoon as they broadcast alarm tones and messages from a command center at very high decibels over the tops of all the houses the city put them in whether or not you voted for it protested against it or begged for it many of us are trapped in the suburbs trapped with mortgages higher than the worth of our homes thanks to fraud at the highest levels of our economy and by the expense of living in the suburbs buried in debt weighed down by consumer goods modern day work commutes with growing gas bills skyrocketing electricity costs being low on liquid assets and living paycheck to paycheck make saving for a move andor a job change very difficult if not impossible if this is not freedom what is it the fact that we are self organizing into units that both create division between neighboring areas and create microcosmic bureaucracy to police ourselves and that we choose to punish non conformity rather than invite individualism says a great deal about our collective mindset we are voluntarily subscribing to rules that divide us and pit us against each other and single out those who disrupt conformity while looking at our world this way is arguably somewhat cynical and less than positive to be mindful of how we are structuring our lives and to acknowledge the dangers of being divided against each other even at the neighborhood level is to be empowered to create a more interesting and fulfilling future let us work toward re invigorating our communities by bucking the need for conformity control and suspicion do your part by being friendly helpful and respectful to your neighbors take on creative and positive initiatives like propaganda gardening and ask questions about the role of authority in our lives take on initiatives like guerrilla gardening that are proving to impact people in powerfully positive ways and get to know the organizations and people who influence your community alex pietrowski is an artist and writer concerned with preserving good

3,clutching at straws the latest solution to contaminated groundwater from fukushimachris carrington everyday tepco pumps tons of water into the damaged reactors to stop them from overheating this water becomes radioactive then seeps into the ground to contaminate the groundwater which finds its way into the ocean they think they know how to stop the contamination even though most scientists are skeptical they intend to do it by drilling a series of wells around number  and   reactors a coolant will be pumped into the wells freezing the soil solid and thus preventing the groundwater escaping well thats the theory at least the fix is set to cost   million to construct and then the running costs on top of that this technique is used in civil engineering projects such as building subway tunnels and the like and it works temporarily but there is no way of knowing how long it will work for source what happens if theres another earthquake what if the power to the pumps is interrupted or the coolant supply runs out none of these issues has as yet been mentioned the same issues arise with the more permanent concrete barriers that some scientists are proposing if they are bottomless the water will just sink into the soil and will still eventuallyend up in the ocean if they have a bottom they will fill up just like a kiddie pool but on a far vaster scale the relative irrelevancyof economics government spying et al comes into very plain sight when you look at what is happening at fukushima yes these other issues are important but the continuance of the human race is at stake here this is why governments will not admit that radiation and radioactive water from fukushima is a problemit is too big a problem for them to deal with we are talking about a situation that will be ongoing for decades marine life which a huge proportion of the global population relies on as a source of protein cannot sustain this kind of punishment on an ongoing basis the very air that we breathe is contaminated and will over time become more so giving rise to increased miscarriages and cancers as the soil becomes more contaminated so will the meat we eat from the cattle that has grazed on it the plants that we rely upon to feed us will either not grow at all or they will be contaminated apart from containing this contaminated water in caskets and burying it for god knows how long all these fixes will amount to nought even if common sense did prevail where in hell could you bury that amount of radioactive waste ask the united nations to evict citizens of some far flung nation so a giant nuclear dump can be created maybe it may sound far fetched but the japanese government and tepco are rapidly running out of fixes the international community is on the surface at least denying there is a problem purely because at this point they have no solution unless something happens soon it wouldnt be incorrect to say that the end of the world as we know it happened on march  th   chris carrington is a writer researcher and lecturer with a background in science technology and environmental studies chris is an editor for the daily sheeple where this first appeared wake the flock up

1,in what may be a disgusting sign of what is to come during a trump presidency a supporter took the opportunity during trumps victory speech to yell out kill obama and trump said nothing   while trump harped on rebuilding americas infrastructure one of his supporters made the comment so loudly that trump actually paused and looked over his young son barron heard it too abc news captured the moment the stunned child had to listen to a grown man advocate killing the current president of the united states he then had to watch as his own father the future president of the united states pretend nothing had happened and simply move on  kill obama  is yelled out  while pundits and the trump campaign claim this election was won by his appeal to the working class who are feeling economic anxiety its clear that even trumps most fervent supporters dont really believe that at what could have been a celebratory moment for the republican campaign and its voters a trump fanatic couldnt help but scream about the only issue he really cared about a violent bloodlust directed at the first black president   and the fact that trump couldnt stand up to this man even after being named president elect speaks volumes hes not in control the mob is and the mob is demanding blood

3,yellowstone super volcano is far bigger than previously thoughtchris carrington the university of utah team found that the magma chamber is some   miles long and it contains up to   cubic kilometers of molten rock if even a third of that volume erupted at yellowstone we would be facing a global disaster prof bob smith one of the utah team leaders said weve been working there for a long time and weve always thought it would be bigger but this finding is astounding dr james farrell also with the utah team added we record earthquakes in and around yellowstone and we measure the seismic waves as they travel through the ground the waves travel slower through hot and partially molten material with this we can measure whats beneath to our knowledge there has been nothing mapped of that size before source yellowstone last erupted    years ago and although the ground in the park is rising there is no indication at this point that its ready to blow again earthquakes are constant within the park and currently there has been no rise in frequency or intensity often a precursor of an impending eruption one day yellowstone will blow and the global effects will be devastating tambora a still active volcano in indonesia exploded in   spewing out an estimated   cubic kilometers of ejecta the eruption threw so much debris into the atmosphere that   became known as the year without a summer crops suffered from the unseasonably cold weather and famine conditions set in its estimated that    people died from the effects of the tambora eruption thats in addition to the    who died on the island at the time of the explosion yellowstone is many times larger than tambora and the world is far more highly populated than it was in   the    deaths from the tambora eruption would appear insignificant if yellowstone blew the nearest thing in size we have to compare with yellowstone is the mount toba eruption some    years ago toba left a crater larger than the city of london in an eruption    times larger than mount st helens source thick ash deposits would cover a large proportion of north america and the volcanic gases and ash thrown into the air would affect our climate for years when yellowstone blows we wont just be facing one year without a summer we will be facing many increasing vulcanism is being recorded around the globe lets hope yellowstone doesnt follow the trend chris carrington is a writer researcher and lecturer with a background in science technology and environmental studies chris is an editor for the daily sheeple where this first appearedwake the flock up

4,just weeks after a summit meeting intended to show a thawing in relations between the united states and russia vice president joe biden made blistering criticisms of russias failing economy loss of face and a leadership that is clinging to something in the past in an interview published saturday speaking on the heels of his trip to georgia and ukraine biden said flatly that the obama administration would make no deals and accept no compromises with the kremlin in exchange for better relations russia itself he said should find it in its own interest to repair relations the kremlin immediately responded to the comments made in an interview with the wall street journal with a demand for a clarification of the administrations intentions toward russia saying essentially that it was receiving a mixed message so soon after president barack obama had visited moscow for the summit meeting calling the criticism perplexing in light of the diplomatic overtures initiated by the united states and described as pressing the reset button the chief foreign policy adviser to president dmitri a medvedev told the interfax news agency the question is who is shaping the us foreign policy the president or respectable members of his team the adviser sergei prikhodko said the atmosphere between the countries had improved since obamas visit early this month if some members of obamas team and government do not like this atmosphere why dont they say so interfax reported him as saying if they disagree with the course of their president we just need to know this in the interview biden set aside diplomatic finesse and offered an unflinching analysis of the current state of affairs in russia beset by falling oil prices with a corruption ridden banking system and failing courts russia has seen the steepest swing from growth into recession of any major economy during the financial crisis biden spoke after visits to ukraine and georgia intended to reassure those countries that us resolve to support their independence would not be weakened by the administrations efforts to improve ties with russia the visits came a year after a brief and limited armed conflict between russia and georgia over separatist regions in the latter the reality is the russians are where they are biden told the wall street journal according to excerpts posted on the newspapers web site they have a shrinking population base they have a withering economy they have a banking sector and structure that is not likely to be able to withstand the next   years theyre in a situation where the world is changing before them and theyre clinging to something in the past that is not sustainable biden rejected recent russian assertions of a restored sphere of privileged interests in areas of the former soviet union made after the conflict in georgia he said he understood the russians would not embrace the american stance but added i do expect them to understand we dont accept the russian claims its a very difficult thing to deal with loss of empire biden said at another point in the most frank discussion yet on russian expectations of the new diplomatic exchanges biden said the russians anticipated that the united states would enter into diplomatic bargaining biden said they think well be duplicitous and say yeah ok we got it well make a deal with you on something else we need in return biden referred to the absence of strong american criticism of russian military operations against separatists in the republic of chechnya some argued the last administration made a deal on chechnya in return for no response on iraq he said were not going to do that its not necessary to do that the russian retort had its own reference to the prior administration albeit an oblique one after noting the ambiguity of who was speaking for the administration the president or his deputy prikhodko said we have been there already

4,in the past year some big insurance companies have won approvals from regulators for premium hikes ranging from   percent to   percent and a round of requests for similar increases has been submitted to the state insurance commissioner in a state parched by a three year drought wildfires are at least partly to blame for the price increases say industry officials and some consumer advocates we seem to be having year after year of major wildfire events when before they occurred every six or seven years said sam sorich president of the california association of insurance cos a lobbying group in sacramento but amy bach executive director of san francisco based united policyholders said she was more concerned about the quality of the coverage than its cost the result she said could be more fire victims finding they didnt have enough coverage to pay the entire cost of rebuilding their homes my big concern is that the insurance companies are going to use these fires as an excuse to increase their rates and the under insurance problem is going to be the same as it ever was bach said people are going to be paying more for less with an estimated   million homes statewide even a tremendously destructive wildfire like the blaze that destroyed    san diego homes in   shouldnt cause a massive surge in the cost of insuring a home experts say in addition rate increases which must be approved by the state department of insurance are based on three years of loss experience delaying the effect on premiums of the fires that occur in any one year dramatic images of firestorms sweeping the san gabriel mountains produce fear and dread but dont make for any actuarial implication said douglas heller executive director of consumer watchdog a santa monica group were talking about not even   percent of homes but the cumulative effect of six years of more frequent larger and costlier fires in built up parts of once rural extended suburbs is bound to show up in homeowners insurance bills industry officials say late in   insurance commissioner steve poizner approved a    percent increase in homeowners insurance for the states biggest insurer state farm mutual and a    percent hike for third ranked farmers insurance a request for a    percent increase at no   allstate corp still is pending the commissioner is reviewing requests for similar sized rate jumps from state farm farmers hartford travelers and a number of smaller companies a spokesman for poizner characterized the premium increases he has approved as negligible compared with a series of rate cuts that began in   under his predecessor john garamendi and continued into poizners tenure which began in   for example premiums dropped   percent at farmers in     percent at state farm in   and   percent at allstate in mid   reductions approved by poizner saved policyholders an estimated   million according to the department of insurance but even as insurers were rolling back rates pressures were building to raise them again a wave of wildfires early this decade combined with the housing boom led to greater than expected increases in rebuilding costs said bob devereux a state farm spokesman faced with potentially catastrophic losses allstate opted in   to limit its risk by no longer seeking new homeowners insurance customers in california said spokesman peter demarco although california for now remains a competitive market for homeowners insurance bach is concerned that more companies could follow allstates lead and partially or completely pull out of the state thats what happened in florida after a rash of hurricanes there im worried that people are going to have fewer choices he said and be forced into a state backed insurer of last resort plan that provides limited coverage a smaller insurance market with poor coverage could exacerbate the under insurance problem following fires that wipe out entire neighborhoods bach said in   poizner proposed legislation to encourage both insurers and policyholders to ensure that dwellings have enough coverage to pay for their reconstruction the bill poizners spokesman said failed to gain traction and was dropped
3,the police state moves into cyberspacestephen lendman contributor the senate will pass or defeat what he wants more than likely itll make cosmetic changes agreed to by housesenate negotiators either that or theyll draft a new bill under a new name little different from cispa to matter last year obama promised to veto the draconian fy   national defense authorization act it authorizes detaining us citizens indefinitely without charge or trial based solely on suspicions baseless allegations or none at allus military personnel are now authorized to arrest and indefinitely detain anyone globally including us citizensdue process civil protections and judicial fairness are null and void presidents may order anyone arrested and imprisoned for life without charge or trial abuse of power has replaced rule of law protections after refusing support obama signed it into law doing so enacted tyranny cybersecurity harshness hardens it if congress sends him a bill hell sign it hes gone along with everything he pledged opposition to as a candidate cispa is more about destroying personal freedom than online security post    it eroded steadily en route to destroying it altogether cispa is another nail in its coffin its burial plot awaits dear lawmakers we are writing you today as professionals academics and policy experts who have researched analyzed and defended against security threats to the internet and its infrastructure we have devoted our careers to building security technologies and to protecting networks computers and critical infrastructure against attacks of many stripes we take security very seriously but we fervently believe that strong computer and network security does not require internet users to sacrifice their privacy and civil liberties the bills currently under consideration including rep rogers cyber intelligence sharing and protection act of   hr   and sen mccains secure it act s   are drafted to allow entities who participate in relaying or receiving internet traffic to freely monitor and redistribute those network communications the bills nullify current legal protections against wiretapping and similar civil liberties violations for that kind of broad data sharing by encouraging the transfer of users private communications to us federal agencies and lacking good public accountability or transparency these cybersecurity bills unnecessarily trade our civil liberties for the promise of improved network security as experts in the field we reject this false trade off and urge you to oppose any cybersecurity initiative that does not explicitly include appropriate methods to ensure the protection of users civil liberties in summary we urge you to reject legislation that uses vague language to describe network security attacks threat indicators and countermeasures allowing for the possibility that innocuous online activities could be construed as cybersecurity threats exempts cybersecurity activities from existing laws that protect individuals privacy and devices such as the wiretap act the stored communications act and the computer fraud and abuse act gives sweeping immunity from liability to companies even if they violate individuals privacy and without evidence of wrongdoing allows data originally collected through cybersecurity programs to be used to prosecute unrelated crimes we appreciate your interest in making our networks more secure but passing legislation that suffers from the problems above would be a grave mistake for privacy and civil liberties and will not be a step forward in making us safer last minute amendments put lipstick on a pig bill sponsor rep mike rogers r mi packaged five   minimization retention and notification amendment it does little to minimize retaining sensitive information nothing with teeth prevents authorities from accessing whatever they wish for whatever alleged reasons privacy and civil liberty protections arent considered   definitions amendment the amendment excludes intelligence pertaining to gaining unauthorized access that solely involves violations of consumer terms of service or consumer licensing agreements and do not otherwise constitute unauthorized access however vague definitions remain authorities can use them to access whatever information they wish   liability amendment its one of the bills biggest problems it creates expansive legal immunity it leaves government and corporations largely unaccountable it provides good faith immunity it means government and business cant be held liable for acting in good faith wholl prove otherwise if they say so no matter whos harmed or how badly   limitation amendment it leaves civil liberty concerns unaddressed its language changed nothing   use amendment it deals with usage of data collected cispas original language let business share it for cybersecurity purposes government can use it for national security reasons new language modestly narrows usage but not enough it still allows data sharing for cybersecurity purposes to investigate alleged online crimes to supposedly protect users from death or harm to prevent minors from accessing pornography be sexually exploited online or otherwise threatened and for national security the latters a catch all excuse to authorize unlimited spying parents not government should handle their childrens online usage alleged online crimes arent defined and no one ever died or experienced bodily harm through cyberspace free pressnets action fund policy director matt wood called cispa a dangerous piece of legislation and its worrisome that the house has passed such an overreaching bill the bill still lacks effective oversight and accountability for companies and government agencies collecting massive amounts of our personal data it would curtail internet openness and freedom by stripping away crucial privacy protections and without providing any guarantee of protection for critical infrastructure if the senate chooses to move forward with cybersecurity legislation we urge senators to make the changes necessary to protect civil liberties and internet freedom cispas little changed from its original form it lets government and companies bypass existing laws access whatever they wish filter content and potentially shut down online access for cybersecurity or national security reasons enactment assures abuse telecommunication companies could monitor personalprivileged content vague language permits virtually anything privacy and first amendment rights will be further eroded en route to destroying them altogether freedoms now taken for granted will disappear any site blog or personal content could be called a cyber threat the current senate version differs little from the house bill it states cybersecurity threat means any action that may result in unauthorized access to exfiltration of manipulation of or impairment to the integrity confidentiality or availability of an information system or information that is stored on processed by or transiting an information system a cybersecurity threat indicator is defined in hugely disjunctive vague scenarios they include for example a method of defeating a technical or operational control merely using a proxy or anonymization service to access sites could be called a cybersecurity threat indicator so could using cryptography to protect personal communications or be able to access systems securely nearly anything could be called a threat everyone is vulnerable for any reason government and business may monitor online traffic and communications without wiretap act or other legal restrictions vague definitions immunize government and business abusers whatever ways house and senate bills reconcile differences existing ones are so minor a final version for obama to sign will change little from what already passed online users will lose out so will everyone police state harshness will be hardened americas already hugely repressive police state america post    draconian legislation executive orders national and homeland security presidential directives and other measures eroded personal freedoms gravely little more remains to eliminating them altogether unprecedented presidential authority alone was freed from constitutional restraints national emergencies and martial law can be declared without congressional approval military commissions legislation scrapped habeas protections fy   ndaa annulled the   insurrection act and   posse comitatus act they prohibited federal or national guard troops for law enforcement unless expressly authorized by congress in times of a national emergency like an insurrection continuity of government cog authority effectively gives presidents and department of homeland security dhs officials police state powers to rule extrajudicially without congressional authority they need only declare a national emergency whether or not justified whistleblowers are an endangered species so are first amendment and other fundamental rights the usa patriot act enacted sweeping new powers bill of rights amendments were eroded or ended first amendment free expression and association rights were targeted belonging to an undesirable group was criminalized fourth amendment protections from unreasonable searches and seizures eroded personal privacy rights were lost first fourth and sixth amendment rights were violated dissent was targeted illegal searches and seizures were authorized the right to counsel and due process were compromised unchecked government surveillance powers to access personal records including online monitor financial transactions student medical and other information were authorized sneak and peak searches permit delayed notice warrants roving wiretaps email tracking and internet and cell phone monitoring domestic spying became easier than ever for the first time the crime of domestic terrorism was enacted as a result anti war activists global justice demonstrators environmental and animal rights adherents civil disobedience and dissent of any kind may be included under its umbrella definition under the patriot acts section   with no hearing or notice washington may confiscate or freeze all foreign and domestic assets of any individual entity or organization accused of engaging in planning supporting concealing or perpetrating any act called domestic or international terrorism against america nonviolent protesters are included other provisions are just as harsh using vague language authorities have wide latitude to twist the law perversely anyone can be targeted for any reason anything can be called terrorism whether or not true democracy was largely ripped up by the roots and destroyed constitutional protections were trashed centralized power was enhanced personal freedoms eroded or ended in march   congress renewed most patriot act powers in may   three key provisions were extended for another four years little debate assured swift passage as a result   unlimited roving wiretaps continue unchecked   section   pertains to alleged suspects it authorizes government access to any tangible item they included financial records and transactions student and medical records phone conversations emails other internet use and whatever else washington claims essential   alleged suspect organizations and individuals can be surveilled whether or not evidence links them to terrorism or complicity to commit it in other words police state powers to monitor anyone for any reason or none at all remain unchecked cispa and whatever else becomes law further enhances unchecked police state powers democracy no longer exists how can it if constitutional statute and international law

4,swiss banking giant ubs on tuesday plunged into further losses during the third quarter as clients shaken by the banks financial troubles and spooked by tax scrutiny withdrew billions of dollars the bank said in a statement that its net loss for the three months to september was   million francs   million euros   million dollars largely hit by credit charges the fallen flagship of switzerlands banking industry also failed to stem an outflow of funds customers withdrew    billion francs over the quarter bringing the total outflows in the first nine months of the year to    billion francs the outflows were particularly marked in the united states where the bank agreed in august to disclose details of    accounts in order to stave off potentially damaging tax fraud charges brought by us authorities the bank had admitted in an earlier case to abetting tax cheats in the united states and paid   million dollars in fines in relation to us crossborder clients we only see outflows ubs chief financial officer john cryan said the banks wealth management americas unit booked    billion francs in outflows in the third quarter up from    billion francs in the second cryan attributed the outflows to the tighter scrutiny from tax authorities as well as to a reputational issue that ubs was struggling to overcome amid its continuing losses we dont see at present a very early return to positive inflows were still executing the exit from us cross border business cryan said i think another factor  is the fact that until we can show a full ifrs international financial reporting standards profit then i think a number of clients will be concerned that we are not generating profitability ourselves generally there is clearly a residual reputational issue we need to face there is a morale issue among our client advisers there has been a tighter scrutiny of tax matters thats not helping value creation in the economy there is a lower level of wealth creation he said cryan also said that for domestic swiss clients outflows would not stop until the bank shows that it is profitable again the zurich based bank one of the biggest losers in the global financial crisis has been struggling to recover since it plunged deep into loss while several other international banks have posted sharp profits for the quarter ubss latest results marked its fourth quarterly loss in a row overall the bank said it expected to see further progress in restoring the underlying profitability of the business in future quarters particularly in   it added that fourth quarter results at its investment bank unit which has been blamed for dragging the bank down during the crisis should reflect the early stage of its recovery analysts highlighted the outflows from the bank net new money outflows were worse than expected with a total outflow of    billion francs versus our expectations of   billion francs said bank vontobel analyst teresa nielsen in our view this indicates that the brand has been more hit by reputation issues than expected especially in the americas she added analysts at bank wegelin said that the net new money outflows and the signs that they would not improve would frighten investors away the only constant in terms of net new money are bad signs they added ubs shares were down    percent at    francs at   gmt the worst performer on the swiss market index which fell    percent

4,beijing has approved plans to build a disney theme park in shanghai a major milestone in the more than decade long effort by walt disney co to expand its reach into china dramatically disney and the shanghai municipal government jointly submitted plans in january to build a    billion park to open as early as   it would be the entertainment giants fourth theme park outside the us after paris tokyo and hong kong    and the first in mainland china the fastest growing mass market in the world the chinese central government approved a broad agreement outlining the legal and financial framework for the theme park the decision clears the way for disney and shanghai to work out detailed plans for building and operating the park addressing such issues as subway and road access to the park as well as finances china is one of the most dynamic exciting and important countries in the world and this approval marks a very significant milestone for the walt disney co in mainland china disney president and chief executive robert a iger said in a statement the new shanghai park would give disney access to   million people who live within a days travel of the city a sprawling affluent and modern metropolis of more than   million people perhaps more important however it would secure a beachhead for disney to sell its products and wield its brand in a market that has tightly controlled the inflow of american entertainment through restrictions on the number of movies allowed in mainland theaters and programs beamed through television channels disney announced the approval in a carefully worded statement tuesday afternoon government controlled china national radio speculated that the timing of the announcement coming in advance of president obamas visit to shanghai this month amounted to a gift the burbank based entertainment giant has been in on again off again discussions about the park since   when the shanghai government initially contacted the company about building a disney world like tourist mecca talks ebbed and flowed with discussions resuming in earnest about two years ago according to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of negotiations in the meantime disney turned its attention to hong kong where it built the   acre disneyland resort that opened in   the company and the hong kong government announced a major expansion in july in hopes of boosting attendance by increasing the number of theme areas to seven from four over the next five years tackling criticism that the worlds smallest disneyland didnt offer enough attractions james h higashi a principal of management resources in tustin a consultant to the theme park industry noted that shanghai was one of the most populated regions in the world offering disney a prime location not only to draw visitors but also to market other disney products such as movies and consumer products to a huge portion of mainland china from a strategic standpoint its one of the best markets in the world higashi said he said disney theme parks have had trouble adjusting to the foreign markets    the paris operation is saddled with huge debt and the hong kong location has operated at a loss    but expects the company to do well in the long run given shanghais rising reputation as one of the worlds premier cities both in culture and business disney would take a   percent equity stake in shanghai disneyland while a joint venture holding company owned by the local government would own the remaining   percent the first phase to be built on about one square mile in what is now a mostly agricultural area between shanghai airport and the pudong business district would include a theme park hotel and shopping district the shanghai park is envisioned as a classic magic kingdom model with a castle at the center but with chinese accents as with disneys other international parks it will give a nod to local tastes and cultures at the disneyland resort in paris wine is served in hong kong the golden mickey show is performed in three languages    cantonese the language of hong kong mandarin which is spoken on the mainland and in english the shanghai park would similarly reflect mainland sensibilities people familair with the plans said dennis speigel president of international theme park services inc a consultant to theme park developers said the latest venture was smart move by disney to stake a claim in shanghai even thought a theme park wouldnt be developed for six to eight years speigel said disney has had some problems adjusting its product to foreign audiences for example he said mickey mouse didnt appeal much to disney guests at the hong kong park until they researched chinese media and mainstream culture and found he would be more appealing without a mouth he also said disney has realized that the hong kong disneyland is too small and confining and has been outdrawn by a nearby marine themed park called ocean park hong kong still speigel said by winning approvals of the chinese government now disney will be in a position to thrive in shanghai when they are ready and the time is appropriate gene jeffers executive director of themed entertainment association a trade group of designers and builders of theme parks and special events said he was optimistic that disney could succeed in shanghai something like this is good for our industry he said nicole liu of the times beijing bureau contributed to this report

3,electromagnetic hypersensitivity from microwave technology finally medically provenby catherine j frompovich an international group of researchers aced it when they published their findings from the clinical study metabolic and genetic screening of electromagnetic hypersensitive subjects as a feasible tool for diagnostics and intervention in the november   issue of mediators of inflammation so the million dollar question has to be when will utility companies get up to speed on the latest in microwave technology damage to the human body also when will public utility commissions nationwide institute proper procedures to protect consumers from such damage pennsylvanians currently are being bombarded by non thermal health problems from public utility companies electric natural gas and water smart meters which operate using microwave technology furthermore the pa house consumer affairs committee chair robert godshall sits on opt out bills that will permit electrosensitive consumers and others to keep safe analog meters which have been in use for decades below is the press release pennsylvania smart meter awareness pasma released november     which discusses pertinent issues to ehs and smart meters electromagnetic hypersensitivity or electrosensitivity ehs is a condition affecting more and more individuals who are exposed to electromagnetic fields emfs and radiofrequencies rfs from radios televisions wi fi dirty electricity coming over household wires from utility companies smart meters sms microwaves photocopiers plus cell phones and towers worldwide the numbers of people affected by emfs and rfs increase exponentially and add to other environmentally sensitivity related illnesses such as multiple chemical sensitivity mcs chronic fatigue syndrome cfs sick building syndrome persian gulf war veteran syndrome and amalgam disease in pennsylvania childrens and adults health is being harmed by electric natural gas and water utility companies smart meters the world health organization who in a december   background paper stated ehs is characterized by a variety of non specific symptoms that differ from individual to individual the symptoms are certainly real and can vary widely in their severity whatever its cause ehs can be a disabling problem for the affected individual  for ehs individuals with long lasting symptoms and severe handicaps therapy should be directed principally at reducing symptoms and functional handicaps this should be done in close co operation with a qualified medical specialist to address the medical and psychological aspects of the symptoms and a hygienist to identify and if necessary control factors in the environment that are known to have adverse health effects of relevance to the patient treatment should aim to establish an effective physician patient relationship help develop strategies for coping with the situation and encourage patients to return to work and lead a normal social life who published online information about that workshop on electromagnetic hypersensitivity in   here pasma wants to remind the pennsylvania state legislature and the pa public utility commission puc that ehs is a harmful healthand even life threateningissue for those affected which utility companies are remiss about in understanding that harm by denying that such effects are medically proven and that sm caused ehs cannotand will notbe mediated by replacing ami sms with emf free analog meters which were used safely for decades and which other states utility companies are allowing the control factor in the environment relevant to many ehs problems is traceable to the installation of smart meters on home properties pasma further wants to point out what the who stated at the emf workshop which utilities the pa legislature and pa puc need to implement help develop strategies for coping with the situation and encourage patients to return to work and lead a normal social life for those ehs individuals impacted by sms legal opt outs from sms are a necessary ethical and medical exception to pa   and must be granted sm induced health issues are serious matters which need to be addressed intelligently by state officials and very soon as too many pennsylvanians cannot lead normal lives due to smart meters pasma respectfully directs pa legislators and the pa puc to clinical studies in the journal mediators of inflammation volume   article id   where researchers published their results regarding ehs in their clinical study metabolic and genetic screening of electromagnetic hypersensitive subjects as a feasible tool for diagnostics and intervention published as an open access article they say till now no causal relationship between electromagnetic fields exposure and onset of clinical symptoms has been clearly proven  the profiles of metabolic parameters alteration observed in ehs subjects were comparable to those of the pure mcs group though generally less pronounced figures   similarly to those mcs patients self reportedly nonelectrosensitive the ehs cohort showed a highly significant versus control decrease in the erythrocyte gst activity and an increase in gpx activity levels figure   coupled with a marked decrease of gsh levels figure    a second parameter proved to be significantly different  between ehs and mcs groups that is the ratio omega  omega   polyunsaturated fatty acids in the erythrocyte membrane phospholipid fraction figure  c  further developments must necessarily include a more objective and standardized classification of individual electromagnetic sensitivity scores to conclusively assess the proposed parameters as a distinctive and specific panel of disease biomarkers for ehs our findings will hopefully contribute in combination with the so far putative genetic risk factors a better molecular definition of environmental borne sensitivity related illnesses and a tool to discriminate single sri comorbidities based on sufficiently proven molecular evidences able to gain clinical consensus smart meter technology is based on microwaves which is damaging the health of pennsylvanians has to be corrected by the pa legislature and pa puc since its counter to and undoubtedly violates the nuremberg code including the third amendment to the us constitution which states the right of the people to be secure in their personsshall not be violated certainly pennsylvanias childrens and adults health status is being compromised and violated     from emfs rfs and the dirty electricity produced by smart meters resource

sick   and lord how can i make it through grieving my loss an inspirational guide through the grieving process   microwaves are weapons of mass destruction and our utilities are serial invaders exposing us    it is time we take our citizens right to action to the forefront on the issues of public safety versus corporate profit our right to life must be protected from a utilities that should have been nationalized decades ago particularly in a commonwealth structure as is the keystone example of pennsylvania the re installation of analog meters will in no way affect the profits of industry as all costs are past on to the consumer utilities are not the people and i should have the right to choose analog metering no matter what these unpatriotic corporations think or do they are licensed entities and their corporate charters can be dissolved just a little correction please it is the fourth amendment that guarantees the right of the people to be secure in their person not the third the us navy conducted extensive studies on wifi radiation in   that proved the serious and harmful effects of microwave radiation in   a blue ribbon panel on the dangers of cell phone radiation came out and declared wifi radiation harmful to all especially children with underdeveloped bone and immune systems yet the findings were suppressed proof homeschool wifi are invisible killing fields especially to children all living biological beings are affected by this electromagnetic radiation see what else you can think of that is poisoning our lives when one and all arise against this psychopathic foolishness it will be consumed by its own lies blessings this sunny cold day not just pennsylvania these meters are popping up everywhere it seems to be common knowledge that emfs are harmful to everyone but the experts who are foisting this death tech on us for a higher profit margin and more control the two sentences they left out of the who ehs citation ehs has no clear diagnostic criteria and there is no scientific basis to link ehs symptoms to emf exposure further ehs is not a medical diagnosis nor is it clear that it represents a single medical problem can we say cherry picking happy to see you back derek ward this gives me another chance to ask you how bc hydro can get a technician to measure the radiation from your smart meter and get zero how did the center for disease control do that derek ward how do you test a bc hydro smart meter rated with a maximum effective isotropic radiated power eirp of   dbm   watt and get a zero how come you will never answer me ehs lacks history lets use microwave syndrome instead which has    years of historical medical military documentation what can a parent do to reduce the radiation in their home this has become endemic all from the push from the energy cabals and our treasonous govt energy officials does anyone have any actual peer reviewed science papers proving this weird assertions
3,the mother of all conspiracies aimed at our childrendave hodges romanian dictator nicolae ceausescu seized hundreds of thousands of children from stable families under the pretense that these children had disabilities which could only be treated by the government in reality this madman planned to use the seized children raised in government orphanages for military and state purposes three hundred thousand children were raised in these state run orphanages romanian encyclopediaadoptioncom had ceausescu survived the vast majority of these children would have been useless to him because there were functionally retarded due to severe neglect after reviewing hhs cps and un documents i have no doubt that obamacare has the same goals and intentions as ceausescu what is being presently reported in the alternative media is merely the tip of the iceberg with regard to hhs intentions toward the ultimate outcome of the children in this country after reviewing the documents there is no doubt that obama is representing international interests which will seek to remove as many children as possible from the homes of their parents in the spirit of ceausescu i freely admit that what i am about to reveal here has made me lose sleep and for the first time contemplate the real possibility of a revolution against the bankers who have hijacked our government i cannot see parents submitting to this tyranny without a fight but first let me quickly review the recent revelations of the hhscpsobamacare intention to conduct what i have dubbed as home invasion interventions according to a previously unreported obamacare regulation that has managed to escape scrutiny from the mainstream media millions of american families will be targeted for home invasion by the forces of the federal government in the name of preventing parental neglect resulting in disabilities in their children and the fourth amendment be damned after january     federal officials may enter your home without a warrant in order to intervene for the purpose of saving high risk children obamacares definition of high risk the exposure of the extreme and intrusive nature of obamacare through home invasions is finally seeing the light of day in the alternative media however this exposure is grossly understated as a starting point i will briefly review what is making the rounds in the alternative media according to human health services your family is eligible for this soviet style intervention in the following situations there is no question that all of the above categories will warrant a home invasion followed by remediation the visits will not be conducted by hhs officials as has been reported in several publications the home invasion visits will beconducted by cps on behalf of hhs hhs has designed a detailed   page policy manual which focuses on the criteria constituting child neglect this policy manual which is the guide created by hhs for cps home intervention visits makes the above criteria presently being reported in the alternative media look tame by comparison hhs cps and the criminalization of parenthood in the   page hhscps manual the variables which comprise child neglect worthy of government intervention is frightening beyond any words i can find to express their undisguised intentions this entire document which will serve as the field manual by cps in support of obamacare undermines parental authority to a level that is beyond belief how many of you were ever grounded by your parents and not permitted to play outside with your friends this is now illegal under the hhscps policy manual they label the treatment as neglect by isolation there are no time frames set forth which constitute isolation and it is left to the field representative this obviously erodes parental discipline if your child is judged to be underachieving in school this is referred to as educational neglect and is worthy of governmental intervention further if your child is absent for five days in any one month from school the same allegation would be made against the parent if your child has add or adhd you could be accused of neglect because the document details how this can be somehow caused by poor nutrition although the variables associated with the cause are not specified the document goes out of its way to specify that poverty and neglect are not inextricably linked then the document goes out of its way to link poverty with child neglect read between the lines america as we already are aware many poor children who go missing from scandals such the second mile foundation the franklin scandal and the latest with the   missing wards of the state in oklahoma frequently end up being put into child sex trafficking rings operated and funded by such notables as dyncorp and hsbc bank of course no obama inspired program would be complete without an attack upon the second amendment obamacare is no exception as one of the criteria for child neglect are parents who are also gun owners the presence of alcohol in the home is a trigger for an allegation of neglect and subsequent intervention of course alcoholic parents can present a clear and present danger to a childs well being however in the policy manual the conditions for concern over alcohol do not detail the amount and percentage of the family resources involved necessary to obtain alcohol in other words one can of beer in the home can be considered to constitute child neglect by the obamacare cps fieldworker if your child has engages in any type of illicit or criminal behavior your family is at risk raise your hands if you ever smoked pot before the age of   or drank as a teen or engaged in any kind of sexual activity before the age of   ever stayed out past curfew or ever shoplifted if your children ever engage in these and a multitude of other transgressions you are in danger of losing your children this also means that if your child is ever involved in a fight in school or is assigned detention the school will be required to report the behavior to the hhscps and you can expect to have a home invasion intervention session with your friendly obamacare cps fieldworker if you are ever late picking up your child from daycare or from school aftercare you will be reported if you have ever been depressed or have been treated for any mental disorder eg ptsd anxiety etc you are at risk for losing your children even illegal immigrant families are not immune from this insanity children are judged by the field worker to not be fully acculturated do not properly speak the language exhibits signs of being homesick and judged to have not formed an unspecified number of friends and formed a cohesive social network allegations of neglect can be made i could literally write   more pages on what cpshhs on behalf of obamacare considers to be parental neglect i would invite the reader to spend some time reviewing the document which will be serving as the policy manual for the forced home inspections please note that when the reader gets beyond the flowery language and professed concern for children that the language is written so broadly that virtually any human condition any family circumstance or childs behavior can be interpreted as child neglect the important thing to note is the use of language by this manual parents who are deemed by an obamacare cps field worker operating under the hhs flag to be neglectful towards their children are considered to have created disabilities within their children as the reader will soon discover the use of the term disabilities is key to understanding how far this administration is willing to go to seize children for some nefarious purpose sadly this is still only the beginning there is far more to be concerned about beginning with who is ultimately responsible for these outrages meet the creators of the state sponsored child kidnapping rings the primary author for this insane manual for hhscps and their designed home invasion interventions is diane depanfilis phd msw she is the associate dean for research and an associate professor of social work at the university of maryland more importantly she is a co editor of the handbook on child protection practice in other words depanfilis has been a major player in the unconstitutional practices we see in cps in all   states as if this is not concerning enough all of the other contributing authors have their professional origins and affiliations with the same organization it was at this point i smelled a rat we have the primary author being a cps author designed to teach their field operatives on the methods of how to abuse parents and undermine parental authority and all of the contributing authors come from the exact same corporation icf at this point it is prudent to ask the question who is icf icf is the biggest player that you have never heard of icf international partners with government and commercial clients to deliver consulting services and technology solutions in climate change energy environment transportation social programs defense and homeland security markets in my mind this established icf as a major player in the introduction and implementation of the globalist agenda by designing matching federal programs and as it turned out they are a major player in obamacare through their subsidiary acquisition caliber associates caliber is an established leader in providing research consulting and innovation in human services and human resource issues icf acquired caliber in   in order to serve hhs the us department of justice the us department of defense and the us department of education caliber associates and their four contributing authors to the hhscps field manual which will be used to enforce child welfare regulations was the undeniable link to obamacare through this field manual but as i discovered the rabbit hole went even deeper after i found the co authors of the hhscps policy manual which will guide these forced home inspections i smelled the distinct odor of the united nations and agenda   and sure enough this was exactly what i found the united nations and obamacare at times i feel that i have the globalist playbook and i am able to often anticipate their next move please allow me to briefly illustrate how the globalists have operated in another area education and then draw the parallel to how the un is deeply involved in obamacare the common core curriculum which is sweeping the nations education system was the product of education for all education for all comes from the united nations education arm the united nations educational scientific and cultural organization unesco common core went from unesco to the national governors association who in turn farmed out the development of the details to various ngos which in turn sent the standards to each state for implementation this is the standard model that the globalists follow when implementing a controversial program and obamacare follows a similar pattern as did common core there is no doubt that the provisions of allegedly protecting children in obamacare originated with the united nations in the united nations document entitled human rights persons with disabilities icf and the un convention on the rights of persons with disabilities training toolkit implementation for programs designed to help people children in particular with disabilities came from the world health organization who page   unesco page   the international labour organization ilo page   and the united nations childrens fund unicefpage   as one can see from the title icf and the un have partnered to protect peoplechildren with disabilities conclusion please remember that earlier in the article i made the point that the hhscps field manual referred to neglected children as children who have disabilities it is quite apparent that any of the conditions listed in the hhscps manual will produce children who have disabilities and in the case of ceausescu in which he seized hundreds of thousands of children who had disabilities and planned to use them for purposes of the state the same picture is beginning to emerge with regard to obamacare and the home invasion visits i can draw no other conclusion than obamacare is state sponsored child slavery under obamacare virtually every aspect of parenting is criminalized any child can be considered to have a disability for which the state is the only legitimate treatment source when obama was first running for president in   he promised to build a civilian security force that was just as strong just as well funded as our military and when one combines this conspiracy with obamas executive order   which calls for a mandatory civilian conscription to complement a military draft it is clear that this lunatic is planning to enslave a large segment of the population and he will obtain many of his conscripts from obamacare and many of you who are familiar with agenda   and their expressed views toward parental rights and the rights of children do not need me to connect the dots you already have done so my advice to all parents dont answer the door on new years day   when obamacare begins to be implemented the common sense show features a wide variety of important topics that range from the loss of constitutional liberties to the subsequent implementation of a police state under world governance to exploring the limits of human potential the primary purpose of the common sense show is to provide americans with the tools necessary to reclaim both our individual and national sovereignty linkwithintextrelated articles
3,your privacy online health information at serious risk of abusepersonal health information historically protected by the hippocratic oath has suddenly become the property of private corporations who may sell it to the highest bidder there is a significant risk to your privacy whenever you visit a health related web page an analysis of over    such web pages shows that nine out of ten visits result in personal health information being leaked to third parties including online advertisers and data brokers this puts users are risk for two significant reasons first peoples health interests may be publicly identified along with their names this could happen because criminals get ahold of the information it is accidentally leaked or data brokers collect and sell the information second many online marketers use algorithmic tools which automatically cluster people into groups with names like target and waste predictably those in the target category are extended favorable discounts at retailers and advance notice of sales given that   percent of bankruptcies are the result of medical expenses it is possible anyone visiting medical websites may be grouped into the waste category and denied favorable offers for individuals this means profiles are built based on web page visits potentially resulting in someone being labeled a commercial risk due to the fact that they have used a site like webmdcom or cdcgov to look up health information for themselves a family member or a friend given that data brokers are free to sell any information they collect regarding visits to health websites those visiting such sites are potentially at risk of being discriminated against by potential employers retailers or anybody else with the money to buy the data these findings are reported in the article privacy implications of health information seeking on the web appearing in the march   issue of communication of the acm timothy libert a doctoral student at the university of pennsylvanias annenberg school for communication wrote the article he authored a software tool that investigates hypertext transfer protocol http requests initiated to third party advertisers and data brokers he found that   percent of health related web pages initiate http requests to third parties seventy percent of these requests include information about specific symptoms treatment or diseases aids cancer etc the vast majority of these requests go to a handful of online advertisers google collects user information from   percent of pages comscore   percent and facebook   percent two data brokers experian and acxiom were also found on thousands of pages google offers a number of services which collect detailed personal information such as a users persona email gmail work email apps for business and physical location google maps libert writes for those who use googles social media offering google a real name is forcefully encouraged by combining the many types of information held by google services it would be fairly trivial for the company to match real identities to anonymous web browsing data indeed in   the the office of the privacy commissioner of canada found google to be violating privacy canadian laws advertisers promise their methods are wholly anonymous and therefore benign libert writes yet identification is now always required for discriminatory behavior to occur he cites a   study where individuals names were associated with web searches of a criminal record simply based on whether someone had a black name personal health information historically protected by the hippocratic oath has suddenly become the property of private corporations who may sell it to the highest bidder or accidentally misuse it to discriminate against the ill libert said as health information seeking has moved online the privacy of a doctors office has been traded in for the silent intrusion of behavioral tracking online privacy has for some time been a concern studies conducted by annenberg dating back to   indicate wariness among americans about how their personal information may be used and slightly more than one in every three americans even knows that private third parties can track their visits to health related websites libert points out that the federal health insurance portability and accountability act hippa is not meant to police business practices by third party commercial entities or data brokers the field of regulation is widely nonexistent in the us meaning that individuals looking up health information online are left exposed and vulnerable according to libert proving privacy harms is always a difficult task however this study demonstrates that data on online health information seeking is being collected by entities not subject to regulation oversight this information can be inadvertently misused sold or even stolen clearly there is a need for discussion with respect to legislation policies and oversight to address health privacy in the age of the internet press source university of pennsylvania
2,bergdahl to receive    in back pay even after reports that bowe bergdahl was a deserter who denounced his us citizenship it appears that our government isnt through with granting him favors instead obama has decided to reward bergdahl even more than he already has as if the price we paid wasnt already enough army regulations imply that bergdahl may be entitled to over    in backed pay for the time he was imprisoned army regulations stipulate that he is entitled to his salary of roughly    a month for his deployment plus benefits such as housing allowance and hostile fire pay according to a report by the washington post with some simple math placing his capture in   that comes out to hundreds of thousand dollars according to former army judge greg rinckey bergdahl is entitled to that money at a later date the army could go back and try to recoup it but at this point he is due his pay to make matters worse liberals are now pushing for bergdahl not to be judged until he is proven guilty and we have all the facts what do you think is bergdahl a deserter does he deserve to be paid
3,missouri voters to consider state privacy amendment with national implicationsselfnews post amendment   would give electronic data and communications the same state constitutional protections as persons homes papers and effects this would eliminate any constitutional ambiguity surrounding electronic data and specifically bar state agencies from accessing it without a warrant in most cases by prohibiting state agents from accessing warrantless electronic data it would make such data gathered by federal agencies such as the nsa and shared with state and local law enforcement inadmissible in state criminal proceedings the law has not kept pace with new technologies as a result both state and federal governments claim broad authority to track innocent peoples movements purchases reading habits and sometimes even private conversations all without a warrant our correspondence and other papers dont become less sensitive simply because we store them in electronic form americans shouldnt face a forced choice between using modern technologies and protecting their privacy amendment   would make it clear that in the same way the government must get a warrant to read peoples postal mail it also must obtain a warrant to read peoples email federal courts havent proved much better judges generally defer to the congress and the president when they justify actions as necessary due to national security issues the law concerning electronic communications remains far from settled and we simply cannot depend on the federal government to protect our privacy while state action like missouris cannot stop the nsa from collecting information illegally it can protect people in that state from its practical effect along with barring state agents from engaging in illegal surveillance it would prohibit state and local law enforcement from accessing warrantless data even if federal courts ultimately place their seal of approval on mass surveillance states can legally set a higher bar for privacy protection than the federal standard this fact alone makes state actions such as amendment   a powerful and effective tool for protecting basic privacy rights if missouri voters approve amendment   it will set the stage for similar initiatives in other states every state except delaware can amend their state constitution through a legislatively referred referendum missouri offers a blueprint we have the potential to blanket the country with constitutional provisions specifically extending privacy protection to electronic information and data this would ensure state level respect for privacy rights and address a practical effect of federal spying regardless of how things play out in congress or in federal courts offnow plans to draft model legislation for introduction in state legislatures during the   session our goal get similar referendums on the ballot and before voters in as many states as possible the offnow coalition is group of grassroots organizations and individuals spanning the political spectrum committed to stopping unconstitutional nsa spying through state and local activism please support the tenth amendment center and the offnow coalition

1,donate  since first being recorded in china in december   the coronavirus covid   outbreak has spread around the world been declared a pandemic and sent billions of people into lockdown as the number of confirmed covid   cases around the world is nearing one million more and more draconian measures limiting the basic freedoms like the freedom of movement and freedom of speech of citizens are being introduced under the pretext of the need to contain the pandemic  these swift and unprecedented changes of the social political system around the world give rise to concerns that the world will never return to the pre covid   state and temporary measures imposed to contain the covid   threat may turn into our new reality  as of april   morning there have been    confirmed covid   cases and    deaths around the world the united states italy spain with       and    cases respectively at the same time the death rate in italy and spain is much higher than in the united states this high death rate every   th infected in italy and every  th infected in spain turned the countries into a center of fear fueled by mainstream media reports designed to generate hype and attract the viewers attention amid the developing crisis bare figures provided by media without any additional context contribute to the growth of fear among the audience and justify further restrictions and emergency measures to contain the pandemic  at the same time a more detailed look at the situation and commentaries by medical experts and scientists indicate that the real covid   threat is lower than media paint it  the global covid   numbers are yet to overcome the average effect of influenza seasons in the united states only    people died during the     season an approximately   month period and     during the     season another   month period  as of april   the     influenza season killed   times more people in the united states than the current covid   outbreak the     influenza season killed approximately   times more people than the covid   outbreak  the sky high covid   death toll in italy also could be a result of several contributing factors    a large part of covid   infected people in italy is constituted of older people  yo that present severe underlying diseases and thus remain in the group of risk in the event of any new disease the cdcs morbidity and mortality weekly report study says that   of hospitalizations   of admissions to the intensive care unit icu and   of deaths associated with covid   were among adults aged   years and older    according to the report by the italian ministry of health the     flu season which was marked by an unusually warm weather led to the deaths of fewer older italians than average in italys northern cities that have borne the most part of italys more than    deaths overall mortality among people age   and over was   below a baseline from previous years in central and southern italy the deaths were   below normal  thus elderly people and those with severe underlying diseases who were spared death by the flu and mild weather from november through january became an outsize target for the covid   outbreak in february and march  the drop in deaths from the     flu season led to an increase in the pool of the most vulnerable people for covid   therefore this part of the italians found themselves exposed to covid   starting from the end of february and that may have contributed to an increase in the impact of the epidemic on the elderly  the association of epidemiologists says that the total number of elderly dead in italy because of the covid   outbreak exceeded the mortality rate from influenza over the past two years but this figure still has not reached the mortality rate three years ago  the robert koch institute a german federal government agency and research institute responsible for disease control and prevention confirms the aforementioned facts in the report released on april   the robert koch institute says that   of deaths occurred in persons aged   years or older  as of april   there have been    covid   cases and   covid   related deaths in germany in comparison the     influenza season affected     people they requested medical aid and led to    deaths  igor alekseevich gundarov a doctor of medicine professor member of the russian academy of natural sciences a specialist in the field of epidemiology and medical statistics notes that the new coronavirus expansion may be linked with the previous successes in the field of combating the flu  the new virus simply filled the created vacuum in the virus micro world that surrounds humanity according to gundarov the current crisis which caused the pandemic of fear additionally to the covid   pandemic is the result of the specific media coverage and political motivated decisions of particular actors  even countries that are almost not affected impose strict measures and limit freedoms of their citizens due to the covid   outbreak a curious situation is developing inside russia as of april   there were    covid   cases that led   deaths only  there is no official data showing some kind of dramatic spread of the disease all people that died from the covid   outbreak are elderly orand people with the severe underlying diseases cancer severe forms of diabetes heart diseases etc  a man of unknown age who died in st petersburg and it was discovered that he had covid   due to a post mortem test  an   year old woman in moscow who suffered diabetes mellitus bronchial asthma and cardiovascular diseases  a   year

 year old man in the moscow region he had chronic diseases of the cardiovascular system kidneys and liver  a   year old man in pskov before being infected with covid   he was diagnosed with lung disease  a   year old main in perm he had severe oncological problems  in response to the situation on march   moscow official population  over   million estimated  up to   million was put under mandatory lockdown under the rules people would be allowed to only leave home for medical emergencies or to buy groceries or medication and only from the nearest shops and pharmacies people can still leave the capital and go to work if this is needed people are restricted to an area within  m of their home the authorities also plan to introduce a smart control system after which residents will not be allowed to leave their homes without permits  on april   moscow mayor sergey sobyanin announced administrative fines for violations of the regime of self isolation in the city the document a law of moscow city was published on the mayors official website the law provides for a fine for violators of up to    rubles    usd and for organizations  up to    rubles    usd meanwhile in another russian region krasnadar krai a fine for violators of the regime of self isolation is    rubles   usd and more  local authorities justified the move with the need to prevent the spread of the covid   outbreak and minimize possible damage from people that violate the regime of self isolation and other important anti pandemic measures this is an important task however under the constitution local authorities do not have the right to introduce such restrictions  in the following few days several other russian regions introduced measures of this kind some of them even entered a mandatory regime of administrative self isolation  for example the republic of chechnya announced that it is closing its administrative borders from april    the republic of crimea announced a regime of self isolation from april   establishing a checkpoint on the bridge with the mainland where all people entering and leaving the republic are checked  the republic of tatarstan overcame even moscow the regime of self isolation was introduced there on april   people there can leave their homes only for emergency medical care or in cases of a direct threat to their lives visit the closest shop to buy food and other essential products walking pets  m from home and move their trash to the nearest place of accumulation of waste people can leave home for a longer distance and for a longer time only under a special permission received via a special sms service  meanwhile the government is imposing severe punishments for spreading false information about the coronavirus and breaking quarantine rules as most regions have gone into lockdown to prevent the spread of the virus the legislation was approved by both houses of the parliament on march   and signed by president vladimir putin on april    here is a brief overview of the new measures prepared by the moscow times  what happens if youre convicted of breaking quarantine rules  you will be fined up to    rubles   companies and public officials face fines of up to    rubles    while legal entities face fines of up to half a million rubles     if the violation causes health issues or death you will be fined up to    rubles    companies and public officials will be fined up to half a million rubles and   million rubles respectively  in what russias consumer protection watchdog has said applies only to legal entities and public officials quarantine dodging can also result in up to two years in prison  if the violation causes one death prison terms increase to up to five years  if the violation causes two or more deaths flouting quarantine rules results in prison terms of up to seven years what happens if youre convicted of spreading false information about covid    under one amendment you will be jailed for up to three years for threatening peoples lives and safety with false information you will also be fined up to    rubles     under the other amendment you will be jailed for up to five years for distributing deliberately false information of public significance if it leads to death or other grave consequences you will also be fined up to   million rubles    who can declare an emergency situation  putin and now the cabinet of ministers in addition to the stiffer fines and long jail terms lawmakers have rushed through bills that grant the russian government the authority to enact a nationwide state of emergency or high alert regime  the kremlin said it supported expanding the governments emergency powers putin has been criticized for falling short of declaring a national emergency or imposing lockdown rules similar to those now in place across us european and other cities  the measures approved by the federal government demonstrate that the russian leadership fully understand the threat of fake news attacks and foreign instigated panic as well as treats seriously destructive actions of separate persons and organizations that intentionally ignore the anti pandemic measures  on the other hand the administrative self isolation measures employed by some regions contribute to the de facto fragmentation of the russian federation and the introduction of orwellian control measures over people living in the key regions like moscow the moscow region and the republic of tatarstan these actions of regional authorities violate both the russian constitution and the federal laws  the spreading regime of administrative self isolation in the russian regions seems to have been initiated by some of the regional elites ienot by the federal center or putin and his team the way that the heads of particular regions are acting makes it look like they are implementing pre planned actions aimed at dramatically increasing their own political power and wresting authority away from the central government  the central government enables this behavior under the pressure of the media and political hysteria around the world or remains misinformed about the real situation  all of these developments came in a very sensitive time for russia which is now passing through the constitutional reform and suffering from the dramatic fall of the oil prices the imposed anti covid   measures also damage the local business and the job market throwing people out of their positions in the event of the negative scenario this may rapidly lead to the deterioration of the social and economic situation across the country  authorities say that introduced surveillance measures and limitations of freedoms will be canceled after the end of the covid   outbreak nevertheless the historical practice demonstrates that there is a nonzero probability that they will remain or will be only partially lifted even after the end of the covid   pandemic  the specific of the russian political culture a complex tangle of contradictions within the russian regional and federal elites as well as the fact that a significant part of the russian elites is affiliated with the collective west contribute to this scenario  therefore the developments triggered by the covid   pandemic may lead to the deformation of the political and administrative structure of the russian federation and lead to notable social and economic tensions if this scenario turns into reality the stability of the entire eurasian region will be undermined  more on the topic  donate
2,what michelle obama did yesterday will make you sick video michelle obama is a lot of things but you would hard pressed to say that she is a good judge of what is appropriate she proved that once more when she took the streets of washington dc with a can of spray paint according to reports from tmz michelle encouraged young people to make a statement by spraying hearts all over a wall to promote international womens day this is not sending a great message considering that graffiti is already an epidemic in america where criminals destroy national landmarks with profanity and art it would appear to us the first lady is endorsing this kind of behavior and the city cant be happy about it watch the video below and tell us what you think
2,putin makes fun of allah in speech video while obama insists on defending islam to the core vladimir putin is not afraid to criticize the religion that is sparking violence throughout the world he has not taken turkeys actions of shooting down his military aircraft at the end of november lightly now he claims that russia is looking into placing more sanctions on the nation we are not planning to engage in military saber rattling putin argued but if anyone thinks that having committed this awful war crime the murder of our people they are going to get away with some measures concerning their tomatoes or some limits on construction and other sectors they are sorely mistaken all in all dear colleagues i do not understand why they did this putin claimed perhaps only allah knows it appears that allah decided to punish the ruling clique of turkey by depriving them of wisdom and judgment he continued in the joke that has since sparked outrage in the muslim community what do you think of putins comment
4,special to the washington post for much of the  th century before the   soviet invasion afghanistan was a peaceful country living in harmony with its neighbors there was a king and a real government which i witnessed in the  s when i frequently traveled there afghanistan had what ill call a minimalist state compared with the vast governmental apparatuses that colonialists left behind in british india and soviet central asia this bare bones structure worked well for a poor country with a small population few natural resources and a mix of ethnic groups and tribes that were poorly connected with one another because of the rugged terrain the center was strong enough to maintain law and order though never strong enough to undermine the tribes autonomy afghanistan was not aiming to be a modern country or a regional superpower the economy was subsistence level but nobody starved everyone had a job though farm labor was intermittent there was a tiny urban middle class but the gap between rich and poor was not that big there was no such thing as islamic extremism or a narco state in   i urged the bush administration to focus on rebuilding afghanistans minimalist state which had been destroyed by   years of war experts in washington some now closely associated with richard holbrooke the us special representative to afghanistan and pakistan estimated then that it would cost the international community about   billion a year for   years to re create a basic afghan state that could counter any threat from al qaida or the taliban the keys were investing in agriculture because that is where jobs lie rebuilding roads that used to link the major cities and border towns so the economy could take off and investing in an afghan army and police force the country also needed a workable government model modern and inclusive education and health programs and a functioning justice system we all know what happened the bush administration left afghanistan underresourced underfunded and in the hands of the cia and warlords and went off to fight in iraq when al qaida and the taliban saw that george w bush was not serious about afghanistan they found it easy to return the insurgency began in summer   as the taliban reoccupied large chunks of the country used drug money to arm its men and improved their firepower and tactics so much that the joint chiefs of staff chairman adm mike mullen recently said the situation is serious and deteriorating now any operation to patch together a minimalist afghan state would cost   billion to   billion a year and require tens of thousands more western troops which nobody is going to provide today washington is bickering over what constitutes success in afghanistan whether the obama plan will work how many more troops and dollars are needed and how to stop its alleged nato allies from slipping out through the back door many dissenters in washington such as columnist george will insist that the afghans are incapable of learning and unwilling to build a modern state others including former british diplomat rory stewart say afghan society should be left alone but the dissenters do not sufficiently acknowledge the bush administrations failures that led us to this impasse worse they offer no solutions so what needs to be done first americans and europeans need to be told the truth their governments have failed them in afghanistan in the last eight years with not a single aspect of rebuilding the minimalist state undertaken until it was too late the capital kabul for example got regular electricity only this year despite billions of dollars in international aid the terrorist threat has grown and al qaida has spread tentacles throughout africa and europe and the west must admit that the taliban has become a brand name that resonates deep into pakistan and central asia and could extend into india and china second the minimalist state must be rebuilt at breakneck speed president obama understands this his plan for the first time emphasizes agriculture job creation and justice on paper at least its an incisive and productive blueprint but will he be given the time to carry it out the democrats want to give him just until next years congressional elections and then start bringing the troops home the republicans are looking for slipups such as the apparent fraud in the presidential election last month so they can pounce but the administration needs up to three years for any chance of success so obamas first task is to create public and congressional support to give the plan sufficient time third the insurgency can never be defeated as long as the rebels enjoy a haven the retreating afghan taliban was welcomed in pakistan in   and is still tolerated there because of a certain logic put forward by the pakistan army that mainly involves containing indias growing power in the region and in afghanistan in particular bush never pushed this issue choosing to treat then pakistani president pervez musharraf with kid gloves today the islamabad government is divided between civilians and the military and as the civilians show themselves more inept the armys power is once again ascendant in recent months the army has seemed more determined to take on the pakistani taliban    since april it has lost   soldiers and killed some    taliban members yet there is no strategic shift to take on the afghan taliban and al qaida in the tribal areas that border afghanistan despite holbrookes attempts to pursue a regional strategy there is still no breakthrough with pakistan and india continues to act tough with islamabad offering the americans little room to maneuver there is no easy way out of this quandary except time and more international aid to pakistan last there must be afghan partners on the ground to help build a minimalist state bush ignored that too the corruption the growth of the drug trade and the failure to build representative institutions after partially successful elections in   and   were all glossed over as bush feted president hamid karzai and did not ask hard questions the apparent rigging of the aug   elections has plunged afghanistan into a political and constitutional crisis for which neither america nor the united nations has any answer but the electoral fraud was assured months ago when karzai began to ally himself with regional warlords drug traffickers and top officials in the provinces who were terrified of losing their jobs and their lucrative sinecures if karzai lost it seemed obvious to everyone except those who mattered in the west to emerge from this mess with even moderately credible afghan partners will be difficult but it must be done the americans could start by forcing karzai to create a government that includes all leading opposition figures without a partner the united states becomes nothing but an occupying force that afghans will resist and nato will not want to support holbrookes skills as a power broker will be sorely tested the obama administration can come out of this quagmire if it aims low targets the bad guys builds a regional consensus keeps the american public on its side and gives the afghans what they really want    merely the chance to have a better life there is no alternative but for the united states to remain committed to rebuilding a minimalist state in afghanistan nothing less will stop the taliban and al qaida from again using afghanistan and now pakistan to wreak havoc in the region and around the world    rashid a pakistani journalist who has covered afghanistan for   years is the author of taliban and descent into chaos the us and the disaster in pakistan afghanistan and central asia

3,why does maryland have the most millionaires per capita the answer might make you angrymichael snyder thanks to wildly out of control government spending the washington dc region is absolutely swimming in cash in fact at this point the state of maryland has the most millionaires per capita in the entire nation and it isnt even close if you have never lived there it is hard to describe what the dc area is like every weekday morning hordes of lawyers lobbyists and government bureaucrats descend upon dc from the surrounding suburbs and at the end of the day the process goes in reverse everyone is just trying to get their piece of the pie and it is a pie that just keeps on growing as government salaries government contracts and government giveaways just get larger and larger of course our founders never intended for this to happen they wanted a very small and simple federal government sadly today we have the most bloated central government in the history of the planet and it gets worse with each passing year if you were to ask most americans they would tell you that the wealthiest americans probably live in cities such as new york or san francisco but thanks to the obama administration and before that the bush and clinton administrations the state of maryland is packed with millionaires in particular the maryland suburbs immediately surrounding dc are absolutely overflowing with government fat cats that make a living at our expense every weekday morning huge numbers of them leave their mini mansions in places such as potomac and rockville and drive their luxury vehicles to work in the city asthe washington post has detailed at this point approximately   percent of all households in the entire state of maryland contain millionaires and the rest of the area is not doing too shabby either in maryland nearly   out of every   households in   had assets topping   million giving the statemore millionaires per capita than any other in the country according to a new report from phoenix marketing international the rest of the beltwayisnt lacking in millionaires either the district and virginia ranked in the top  among those with the highest number of millionaire households per capita in   in virginia which was no  on the list    percent of the states    million households are millionaires and in the district which rounds out the top      percent of its more than    households are millionaires and while not too many of them are millionaires your average federal workers that toil in dc are doing quite well too once upon a time it was considered to be a sacrifice to go into government service not anymore if you can believe it approximately    federal employees made more than    last year overall compensation for federal employees comes to a grand total of close to half a trillion dollars every   months in fact there are tens of thousands of federal employees that make more than the governors of their own states do does that seem right to you if you want to live the american dream these days the washington area is the place to go just check out the following description of the region from the washington post washingtonians now enjoy the highest median household income of any metropolitan area in the country and five of the top   jurisdictions in america loudoun howard and fairfax counties and falls church and fairfax city are here census data shows and of course let us not forget the fat cats in congress accordingto cnn our congress critters are now wealthier than every before the typical american family is still struggling to recover from the great recession but congress is getting wealthier every year the median net worth of lawmakers was just over   million in   or   times the wealth of the typical american household according to new research released monday by the center for responsive politics and while americans median wealth is down   since   congress members net worth has jumped   not only that there are nearly   members of congressthat are actually multimillionaires nearly   are multimillionaires one hundred are worth more than   million the top   deal in nine digits the annual congressional salary alone   a yearqualifies every member as the top   percent of earners none of them are close to experiencing the poverty reduction programsaffordable housing food assistance medicaidthat they help control though some came from poverty a recent analysis by nicholas carnes in his book white collar government the hidden role of class in economic policymaking found that only   out of   members of congress from   to   came from a blue collar upbringing incredible but even though almost all of them are quite wealthy they dont hesitate to spend massive amounts of taxpayer money on their own personal needs for example according to the weekly standard more than five million dollars was spent on the hair care needs of us senators alone over one recent   year period senate hair care services has cost taxpayers about    million over   years they foot the bill of more than    for the shoeshine attendant last fiscal year six barbers took in more than    each including nearly    for the head barber and in one recent year an average of     was spent on personal and office expenses per us senator so the grand total would have been over   million dollars for a single year that seems excessive doesnt it and even when they end up leaving washington our congress critters have ensured that they will continue to collect money from us taxpayers for the rest of their lives in     former lawmakers who retired under a former government pension system received average annual pensions of    according to a congressional research service report they averaged around   years of service at the same time another   retirees elected in   or later with an average of   years of service received average annual checks of roughly    a year if you can believe it there are quite a few former lawmakers that are collecting federal pensions for life worth at least    annually the list includes newt gingrich bob dole trent lott dick gephardt and dick cheney of course the biggest windfalls of all are for our ex presidents most americans would be shocked to learn that the us government is spending approximately    million dollars a year to support the lavish lifestyles

2,bruce caitlyn jenner challenged tom selleck learns a quick lesson after bruce caitlyn jenner revealed her new female identity and look on the cover of vanity fair she became an instant sensation among liberals some even went so far as to call her a goddess of course not everyone is accepting her plastic surgery fueled approach to womanhood during a recent interview tom selleck spoke out against plastic surgery ive never done it selleck said when he was asked about the topic i dont have a problem with it as long as its not just vanityi dont have anything really against it if i can look at it as a tool and not a kind of narcissistic manifestation of vanity which it probably is anyway but i do think theres a difference between that kind of vanity and your work if it allows you to do your job and be accepted in a larger variety of things i think its okay sellecks points make sense surgery isnt a quick fix for confidence and self acceptance what do you think do you support sellecks views of surgery
1,since the mainstream media wont do their job people everywhere are making it a point to go through the wikileaks emails to uncover the truth that the political elite are trying to hide upon perusal of the emails leaked yesterday in dump number   an interesting discussion surfaced exposing how muslims got in obamas administration and its so unbelievable you have to read it for yourself   under the subject line  asian american candidates muslim american candidates  we get some juicy insight into how these candidates got into the obama administration however the first thing that should stand out like a sore thumb is the date of this email october     was about   weeks before obama was elected muslims were chosen to be in the obama administration weeks before his election   the date indicates that gayle smith and john podesta were staffing the obama administration with muslims weeks before barack obama was actually elected this is not mainstream information but mad world news noticed that obama was transitioning to the white house long before the election even took place unfortunately that is not the worst part of this email   the fact that muslims were selected for the obama administration before the american public voted for him is not a good sign but it doesnt look like obama chose these appointments either hes not included in the conversation about who will be in his cabinet leading skeptics to believe that this is all a setup the date on this is september of   well before obama was elected note the highlighted areas where christians are specifically excluded   the even more terrifying aspect of this email is highlighted i excluded those with some arab american background who are not muslim eg george mitchell many lebanese americans for example are christian those who selected obama before the election handpicked muslims for his administration knowing hed be elected not only that they specifically excluded christians   this particular email does not list a reason why christians were excluded and muslims were chosen specifically because of their religion but with several more days of wikileaks podesta email dumps we may get some answers but thats still not all the email also indicated that a list for muslim doj and judges would come soon   later in the email right before signing off preeta bansal  an indian american lawyer who ended up in the obama administration as the general counsel and senior policy advisor to the federal office of management and budget from   until   says the muslim list for the doj department of justice will be on its way soon not long after the list of muslim judges and us attorneys to appoint will follow   now we know how the obama administration was packed with muslims but we still arent sure why maybe they were hoping to avoid discrimination  or perhaps the reason is more sinister perhaps the infiltration of the us government with muslims is a preplanned way to slowly allow the religion to permeate the west although that seems far fetched this email is absolutely horrifying and nothing should shock us anymore after reading these leaked emails

4,special to the washington post when lauro l baja jr returned to his native philippines in   he had just finished a four year stint as ambassador to the united nations that included two terms as president of the security council a storied diplomatic career that began in   culminated with the philippine president conferring upon him the highest award for foreign service then a three month episode from his un days returned to haunt him he was sued by marichu suarez baoanan who had worked as a maid in new york city for baja and his wife norma castro baja baoanan   said the bajas brought her to the united states in   promising to find her work as a nurse instead baoanan said she was forced to endure   hour workweeks with no pay performing household chores and caring for the couples grandchild baja denied the charges saying baoanan was compensated he also invoked diplomatic immunity    a right that usually halts such cases in their tracks but in june a federal judge in manhattan ruled that the former un ambassador could not claim immunity because baoanans duties benefited the baja familys personal household needs and are unrelated to bajas diplomatic functions baoanans attorney ivy suriyopas called the ruling an important shift in cases involving diplomatic immunity only one other case involving diplomatic immunity and domestic workers was able to progress this far suriyopas said bajas attorney salvador e tuy called the charges untrue the trial is ongoing the case highlights what advocates call a longtime pattern of trafficking and exploitation of domestic workers by foreign diplomats in the united states unfortunately cases involving diplomatic employers represent a disproportionate amount of the domestic worker abuse cases we see said suzanne tomatore director of the immigrant women and children project at the new york city bar justice center a july   government accountability office report identified   cases of abuse by diplomats over an eight year period but emphasized that the actual number was probably higher nobody expected a number this big said thomas melito gao director of the section on international affairs and trade under the vienna conventions diplomatic immunity provides a shield from prosecution that is almost absolute said george washington university law professor sean murphy who spent   years in the state departments office of the legal adviser advocates and lawyers say that the us government does little to protect workers or hold foreign diplomats accountable local law enforcement is often the first to learn of allegations however with a diplomat involved local authorities must wait for guidance from the justice department federal law enforcement doesnt have the capacity to take on every abuse allegation and local law enforcement isnt always equipped to do so victims of abuse and trafficking find themselves in the gap between tomatore said justice must confer with the state department the gatekeeper for all complaints against diplomats as officials at state weigh the implications of criminal or civil proceedings a case can take months to resolve the gao said justice spokesman alejandro miyar said the gao may have overstated the delays although justice declined to say how many probes it had undertaken the gao report cited   trafficking investigations involving foreign diplomats from   to   no case brought an indictment state department officials say they must balance protocol and worker protections luis cdebaca the ambassador at large on trafficking issues said that his office takes abuse reports seriously but that the issue presents unique challenges immunity should not mean impunity to enslave domestic servants on us soil and we will continue to work to ensure that these domestic workers are accorded full rights and human dignity in our country cdebaca said but state has yet to deny or revoke a diplomatic visa or implement sanctions as a result of an abuse allegation there are signs of progress in february   state sent pamphlets to all overseas posts to inform incoming a  g   visa holders of their rights consular officials must verify that each applicant has understood the information the pamphlet is available only in english in december congress reauthorized the trafficking victims protection act with safeguards for visa holders the law now requires state to assume greater oversight of complaints and cooperate more closely with justice but the state department has been slow to implement the policy changes required under the law a spokesperson for the department recently said protocol hopes to introduce new measures to deter abuse

1,the world health organization has urged people to stop using cash asking citizens of the world give up their economic and social freedom in the name of stopping the coronavirus  following reports that beijing had quarantined dirty cash the who warned on monday that the virus could survive on banknotes potentially spreading covid   within communities and across the world  the establishment is now suggesting that paper money be removed from circulation because it is a viral spreader  to reduce the risk of being infected by money the ngo advised citizens in countries struggling with outbreaks to favor digital payments when possible the daily telegraph reported  zerohedge reports that the who is telling the public to avoid cash is hardly a surprise research has found that coronaviruses have been found to live on surfaces for as long as   days  during the statement a who spokesman referenced a bank of england study claiming that banknotes can carry bacteria or viruses and urged people to wash their hands other studies have shown that   of us   bills had bacteria present and one swiss study found that viruses had survive on the faces of swiss francs for days  the whos warnings follow the peoples bank of china last month started disinfecting currency deposited at chinese banks using ultraviolet light before quarantining the bills for a week before releasing them back into circulation  brits and their fellow europeans should be increasingly careful as the virus spreads across europe the who warned via the telegraph  we know that money changes hands frequently and can pick up all sorts of bacteria and viruses a spokesman told the telegraph we would advise people to wash their hands after handling banknotes and avoid touching their face when possible it would also be advisable to use contactless payments to reduce the risk of transmission  of course that one of the worlds major ngos is seizing the opportunity to proclaim the virtues of paperless money is hardly a surprise the globalist push toward a cashless society has been underway for years now having had its biggest successes in scandinavia sweden has gone virtually cashless and in such a short time theyve already confronted the many drawbacks of relying exclusively on digital money  as we noted previously here is what happens next  the virus spreads throughout the us and europe and governments respond the same way chinas government has martial law and full blown concentration camp culture this would lead to civil war in the us because we are armed and many people will shoot anyone trying to put us into quarantine camps europe is mostly screwed the establishment then suggests that paper money be removed from the system because it is a viral spreader china is already pushing this solution now magically we find ourselves in a cashless society in a matter of a year or two which is what the globalists have been demanding for years everything goes digital and thus even local economies become completely centralized as private trade dies  a viral outbreak is a significant danger to us all but an even greater threat is the supposed cure trading our economic and social freedom in the name of stopping the coronavirus no matter how deadly the bug its just not worth it

1,attorney general william barr is considering taking legal action against governors who continue to impose draconian unconstitutional rules for dealing with the coronavirus  harsh restrictions such as stay at home orders and shutting down businesses are justified up to a point barr said in an interview tuesday on the hugh hewitt show  eventually though states should move to fairer more targeted measures barr said  we have to give businesses more freedom to operate in a way thats reasonably safe barr said to the extent that governors dont and impinge on either civil rights or on the national commerce  our common market that we have here  then well have to address that  yahoo news reports barrs comments come as the trump administration and states are struggling  and at times fighting with each other  over the best strategy to deal with the crisis trump has stoked tensions with some democratic governors who are dealing with protests against stringent social distancing rules even as his administration backs guidelines that call for states to open up gradually  one way the justice department might act against state or local officials is by joining lawsuits brought by citizens or businesses over restrictions barr said he acknowledged that state governments are at a sensitive stage as they try to balance health and safety against pressure to reopen but he said that as lawsuits develop as specific cases emerge in the states well take a look at them  were looking carefully at a number of these rules that are being put into place barr said and if we think one goes too far we initially try to jawbone the governors into rolling them back or adjusting them and if theyre not and people bring lawsuits we file statement of interest and side with the plaintiffs  in a sign of the presidents contradictory messages on the issue trump tweeted last friday that his supporters should liberate minnesota michigan and virginia  three states with democratic governors and strict stay at home orders the move came just a day after trump outlined the return to work guidelines that are contingent on states meeting specific benchmarks on testing and a decline in covid   cases  off the rails  washington governor jay inslee a democrat responded angrily to trumps tweets accusing him of fomenting rebellion and spewing dangerous anti democratic rhetoric  the white house released a sensible plan inslee said in a statement and less than   hours later the president is off the rails  trump will meet with one democratic governor new yorks andrew cuomo at the white house on tuesday cuomo said hell use his   pm session in the oval office to lobby for more supplies needed to process coronavirus tests trump last week said states have the primary responsibility to expand virus testing  the latest developments signal that as trumps public support over his handling of the virus crisis weakens he and his top aides are increasingly looking at ways to move on  pressuring barr  conservative groups and activists have been ramping up pressure for the trump administration  and barr in particular  to act against governors taking a hard line  alleging rampant abuses of constitutional rights and civil liberties a group led by former attorney general ed meese wrote barr this week urging him to undertake immediate review of all the orders that have been issued by the states and local governments across the nation  in tuesdays radio interview barr said these are very very burdensome impingements on liberty and we adopted them we have to remember for the limited purpose of slowing down the spread that is bending the curve we didnt adopt them as the comprehensive way of dealing with this disease  you cant just keep on feeding the patient chemotherapy and say well were killing the cancer because we were getting to the point where were killing the patient barr said and now is the time that we have to start looking ahead and adjusting to more targeted therapies

3,powerful liberty quotes that will inspire you to live freeby joseph jankowski with the rise of the police state nsa spying and extremely dangerous executive orders americahas fallen in many of the metrics that rank countries based on their level offreedom the american way of life that once looked at government as an entity which the people should avoid being parasitic to and as an institution that should remain as small as possible has gone completely to the wayside a profound example of how large the us federal government has grown is the fact that the department of health and human services is set to spend over   trillion in   that is just one agency out of hundreds our once free society now labors to pay off big government in america today it is those who cherish freedom who are labeled as dangerous a study by thedepartment of homeland security has labeledthose who are reverent of individual liberty as potential terrorists according to this department of defense manual people concerned with individual liberties states rights and how to make the world a better place are potential extremists freedom is under siege in america of course the only way to turn this around and restore our libertiesis to get motivated here are   libertyquotes that will surely get you in the spirit to live free a profound example of how large the us federal government has grown is the fact that the department of health and human services is set to spend over   trillion in   that is just one agency out of hundreds our once free society now labors to pay off big government over half of that is for medicare which we have earned by funding our entire lifetimes   is for healthcare   is for snap the majority of recipients are children so medical treatment and food for the needy with medicare being mostly self funded thru payroll taxes and very popular of every dollar medicare or medicaid takes in    is returned to the private sector to private doctors and hospitals of snap   is returned to the private sector for food lets compare the defense budget which is also a trillion dollars  k or the dod   billion to the banks to pay the debt on previous wars and the other   billion for dept of energy nukes homeland security and the va   borrowed with   being debt repayment it buys weapons healthcare for wounded vets maintenance of enough nukes to destroy the planet   times and funds for spying etc it is   times larger than chinas defense budget and   times larger than russias so medical treatment and food for the needy with the largest chunk mostly self funding medicare or a defense budget which buys weapons repays banks and funds spying larger than the next   nations which one do you feel robs you of your tax dollars and your freedom   a day for poor seniors and the disabled children and minimum wage workers and those whose jobs have been shipped offfshore or a    trillion fighter yet contract to lockheed for a plane which is considered a lemon unable to compete with russian and chinese fighters and with only   completed has already cost nearly half a trillion with routine cost overruns and plagued by problems based on an  s design with too little power no ability to maneuver and easily detected which one pisses you off are you with trump who says he will build up the military so big it will never have to be used   of arms races end in war causing other nations to build up their militaries in self defense or with eisenhower who said every gun that is made every warship launched every rocket fired signifies in the final sense a theft from those who hunger and are not fed those who are cold and are not clothed this world in arms is not spending money alone it is spending the sweat of its laborers the genius of its scientists the hopes of its children this is not a way of life at all in any true sense under the clouds of war it is humanity hanging on a cross of iron  guns or healthcare bombs or food the rockefeller driven medical industrial complex has become the monstrosity it was designed to be medicare spending has traditionally been funded   by payroll taxes and   through the general fund and this was before medicare part d was passed under bush ii a huge unfunded liability roughly the us governments contribution to health care spending was   before obamacare medicare medicaid va us military tricare etc and is close to   when employer tax subsidies are factored in these programs and the insurance mafia have combined to create medical hyperinflation such that it is nearly impossible for the average family to pay for the majority of their basic health care needs out of pocket in the late  s it wasnt uncommon for a woman to be discharged from a hospital a day or two after giving birth with a   bill all fees included you are misinformed medicare is funded primarily from three sources general revenues   payroll taxes   and beneficiary premiums   so it is just over half self funded with    of the money going back to private doctors and hospitals defense spending is   borrowed costing   billion a year more than any other nationss total defense spending in debt repayment to banks for previous wars the money collected thru taxes goes to weapons makers and spies among others the    trillion f   fighter yet which pilots say cannot perform will end up costing about    per household medicare part d is a scam whereby medicare is prevented from negotiating drug prices it should get the cheapest causing it to pay nearly twice as much as other agencies like the va or much smaller groups which has thereby in violation of all freemarket principles stolen about   billion since the republicans passed it a simple solution repeal the ban on medicare negotiations and enact medicare for all saving   billion in overhead per yr as well as eliminating the   billion spent on er for the uninsured and   billion lost thru the tax break for medical costs that is more than enough to expand coverage to everyone with   coverage including dental and vision other ways to save can be taken from the other   advanced nations which have superior health outcomes at half the cost including free tuition for qualified medical students and paying doctors to keep us healthy more than half of americans now support single payer with   of democrats in favor youll get no argument about medicare part d being a scam and effectively a way to keep patients from scrutinizing prescription costs self educating on cost benefit ratio and making informed decisions resulting in the eventual strangling of big pharma medicare premiums are offset by medicaid for low income seniors there are endless shell games with taxes and govt spending all lack the transparency resiliency and freedom associated with direct patient to provider payment paradigms government programs can offer remarkable benefits yet disempower too i know first hand my spouse is a va doc and from my own grad studies in public health medical economics and preventive medicine humanity needs a balance and free choice not the rockefellers centralized top down system heres some great rockefeller driven medical industrial complex historical irony to reflect on i assume you know william rockefeller the rockefeller patriarch who boasted he taught his sons how to cheat was literally a snake oil salesman billing himself as dr bill levingston celebrated cancer specialist chased out of towns by angry residents after selling rock oil a combination of laxative and petroleum for   a substantial financial sacrifice for most claiming it would cure most terminal cancers heres a clue anyone who offers you fake quotes is not looking out for your freedom for example heres another fake quote paine the duty of a patriot is to protect his country

order from an oz place your order now at  cannabisplug com if the american people ever allow private banks to control the please send me my share of the things in your home you may think i am joking as you dont know me that can be forgiven there is not much i use what i do use is stuff youre more than welcome to come and share whatever i use the optimal word here is share stuff things on earth will never come with me when im gone stuff wont go with you when you go either im not really attached to stuff yes i use some of it but not much dont mind sharing it is here for all of us after all i am not joking i am not being sarcastic this is how i view materials used in living all resources on the earth belong only to the earth we own nothing only get to use stuff so yes come share in the stuff i use if you need sorry im too strapped of that silly money stuff to pack up my stuff and distribute it to you i dont like to play that silly money game much at all it only serves death by way of greed i only use of it what is needed to use other stuff and more often than not i let my wife manage that she allows me a small stipend for some hobby stuff im out of the money stuff in that stipend but you come on you can share our stuff we use if you need glad to share genuinely am again not joking hi ben thank you for replying in some respects we are on the same page i am not attached to stuff i only have what i need i do note care much for money and my wife manages it with me only buying the odd tool or book i also kinda but not completely view myself as a custodian of things and tend towards generosity with them sharing is good where we appear to differ is in our philosophical underpinnings the following are phrases i copied n pasted from your reply which i would like to discuss further we own nothing the optimal word here is share and money only serves death by way of greed you may already be conversant with the concept of ownership but i will elaborate for the benefit of others ownership or property rights is a mental construct a norm designed to minimise conflict over scarce resources by definition ownership defines who has control over a scarce resource such that its owner has complete control over its use or lack thereof and its disposal the owner can lend or rent out a resource he controls ie permit use by another while retaining title or alienate the resource ie pass title to another by exchange or by gifting the ownership norm minimises conflict because the agreement of only the current owner needs to be sought in order to gain access to a resource again by definition if no one owns anything then either no scarce resource has a controller or all seven billion and counting of us have joint control and both of these present difficulties i am going to use the dwelling you currently occupy as an example and for simplicity i will refer to it as your house your house is a scarce resource there is only one of it if no one owns your house then anyone can simply walk in at any time and take up residence without your consent how can you say no or its not your turn you dont control its use nobody does the only way you could guarantee permanent single occupancy would be by massive security and overwhelming force is that better than ownership things are even more complicated if we all have joint ownership of your house if you own one seven billionth of your house you can only guarantee occupancy for one seven billionth of its usable life which seven billionth is yours and how was that decided why was i not invited to the meeting that decided did someone else decide on your time slot without consulting me this arrangement is obviously unworkable and i assume that you are espousing option one above your phrase optimal word here is share implies that you are willing to allow me or others access to resources currently in your stewardship only the owner can allow something if you permit me to share something you must also be able to deny me it too that my friend is ownership the reason we can share our resources with others without losing control of them is that we own them as i am sure you are aware money is simply a tool an important use of which is to make trade more efficient by being the most liquid good and therefore desired by all if you have eggs but require boots you must first find a cobbler who wants eggs right now not very efficient tools are neutral ie they are neither good nor evil i can use a hammer to build you a barn or to bash your skull in it is the use made of a tool that is good or evil i completely concur that the banksters use their central bank issued fractional reserve debt as money for the purposes of slavery and world domination but the problem is not money per se they might intend to enslave us but we do not have to fall into their trap their so called money might be a debt instrument but possessing a bank promissory note means that it is you that is owed not them they win when you borrow from them dont take out a loan dont use a credit card and dont keep your money in their banks and you are not feeding the system it is the love of money that is the root of evil not money itself btw i never thought you were joking i find it interesting that all these liberty quotes come from men many of whom were part of the disenfranchisement of over half the population

3,us helping isis one accidental airdrop vs billions in covert aidtony cartalucci while the us claims it has accidentally allowed weapons to fall into the hands of isis terrorists in reality the us has been arming funding and aiding isis and its terrorist affiliates either directly or through saudi qatari jordanian or turkish proxies since at least   isis didnt happen overnight far from springing from the dunes of northern iraq or eastern syria the rise of isis is the verbatim fulfillment of long established documented us conspiracy it is perhaps best summarized by the prophetic   report the redirection is the administrations new policy benefiting our enemies in the war on terrorism written by pulitzer prize winning journalist seymour hersh and published inthe new yorker it stated emphasis added to undermine iran which is predominantly shiite the bush administration has decided in effect to reconfigure its priorities in the middle east in lebanon the administration has coperated with saudi arabias government which is sunni in clandestine operations that are intended to weaken hezbollah the shiite organization that is backed by iran the us has also taken part in clandestine operations aimed at iran and its ally syria a by product of these activities has been the bolstering of sunni extremist groups that espouse a militant vision of islam and are hostile to america and sympathetic to al qaeda what is isis if not an extremist group that espouses a militant vision of islam and is sympathetic to al qaeda and surely isis is undermining both iran and syria and for that matter hezbollah in lebanon and irans allies in iraq as well the rise of extremist groups in the wake of the us engineered arab spring is the story of how these clandestine operations reported on by hersh reached their pinnacle in the creation of isis the us state department through its global network of foreign subversion funded and directed by the national endowment for democracy ned and a myriad of faux ngos triggered a coordinated uprising across the middle east protesters served as a smoke screen behind which heavily armed militants began campaigns of violence against the security forces of the respective nations targeted for destabilization violence in egypt went largely unreported because of the speed of which the government collapsed and confrontations ceased however in nations like libya and syria where governments remained resolute the violence continued to escalate while the united states attempted to feign ignorance surprise and even displeasure with the arab spring it would soon openly align itself with each and every opposition group across the middle east in libya us senator john mccains visit to benghazi libya would be the political manifestation of military financial and diplomatic aid being rendered to militants fighting against the government of muammar qaddafi these fighters it would turn out were not pro democracy rebels but rather seasoned militants of the libyan islamic fighting group lifg an official al qaeda franchise in north africa one of their leadersabdelhakim belhadj would eventually find himself in power in tripoli after the collapse of the libyan government and have his photograph taken with senator mccain after the fall of libya al qaeda and its affiliates would take their fighters and their nato supplied weapons and travel to fight in syria they would enter the country through nato member turkey while the us has repeatedly referred to the militants fighting the government and people of syria as moderates the vast majority of these fighters are sectarian extremists many of whom are not even syrian and while the united states and its allies attempt to claim the rise of isis is recent the many terrorist organizations it is a consolidation of where involved in syrias fighting since it began in   the us state department itself would admit that al qaedas syrian franchise jabhat al nusra an offshoot of isis was among the most prominent armed militant groups fighting the syrian government beginning in   onward the us state departments official press statement titled terrorist designations of the al nusrah front as an alias for al qaida in iraq stated explicitly that since november   al nusrah front has claimed nearly   attacks ranging from more than   suicide attacks to small arms and improvised explosive device operations in major city centers including damascus aleppo hamah dara homs idlib and dayr al zawr during these attacks numerous innocent syrians have been killed billions in weapons cash and equipment it is clear that al qaeda was virtually handed the nation of libya by nato intentionally it is also clear that al qaeda was quickly mobilized to then push into syria and repeat natos success this time by toppling damascus the plan as it was imagined was to topple damascus quickly enough so that the general public never found out who was truly fighting in the ranks of americas proxy forces this because of the syrian peoples resolution didnt happen from   onward the united states and its allies both european and regionally would supply terrorists fighting the government of syria billions in cash weapons equipment and even vehicles story after story in the western press admitted this but always with the caveat that the aid was going to so called moderates for three years these moderates received the combined aid from the united states united kingdom members of the european union turkey saudi arabia qatar and jordan in the telegraphs   article titled us and europe in major airlift of arms to syrian rebels through zagreb it is reported    tons of weapons dating back to the former yugoslavia have been sent in   planeloads from zagreb airport to the rebels largely via jordan since november the shipments were allegedly paid for by saudi arabia at the bidding of the united states with assistance on supplying the weapons organised through turkey and jordan syrias neighbours but the report added that as well as from croatia weapons came from several other european countries including britain without specifying if they were british supplied or british procured arms british military advisers however are known to be operating in countries bordering syria alongside french and americans offering training to rebel leaders and former syrian army officers the americans are also believed to be providing training on securing chemical weapons sites inside syria additionally the new york times in its article arms airlift to syria rebels expands with cia aid admits that with help from the cia arab governments and turkey have sharply increased their military aid to syrias opposition fighters in recent months expanding a secret airlift of arms and equipment for the uprising against president bashar al assad according to air traffic data interviews with officials in several countries and the accounts of rebel commanders the airlift which began on a small scale in early   and continued intermittently through last fall expanded into a steady and much heavier flow late last year the data shows it has grown to include more than   military cargo flights by jordanian saudi and qatari military style cargo planes landing at esenboga airport near ankara and to a lesser degree at other turkish and jordanian airports the us state department had also announced it was sending hundreds of millions of dollars more in aid equipment and even armored vehicles to militants operating in syria along with demands of its allies to match the funding to reach a goal of over a billion dollars the nyt would report in their article kerry says us will double aid to rebels in syria that with the pledge of fresh aid the total amount of nonlethal assistance from the united states to the coalition and civic groups inside the country is   million during the meeting here mr kerry urged other nations to step up their assistance with the objective of providing   billion in international aid the us has also admitted that it was officially arming and equipping terrorists inside of syria the washington posts article us weapons reaching syrian rebels reported the cia has begun delivering weapons to rebels in syria ending months of delay in lethal aid that had been promised by the obama administration according to us officials and syrian figures the shipments began streaming into the country over the past two weeks along with separate deliveries by the state department of vehicles and other gear a flow of material that marks a major escalation of the us role in syrias civil war recently when the us state department resumed sending non lethal aid to syrian rebels the delivery list included   toyota trucks hiluxes were on the free syrian armys wish list oubai shahbander a washington based advisor to the syrian national coalition is a fan of the truck the question is if billions in saudi qatari jordanian turkish british and american aid has been sent to moderates who has been funding arming and equipping isis even more americas narrative beggars belief so many resources does isis have at its disposal that it is not only supposedly able to displace the so called moderates in syria but has the ability to simultaneously fight the combined military might of lebanon syria and iraq not to mention threaten the national security of russia and china and so we are meant to believe carry out a global campaign of terror against western targets from canada and the united states across europe and all the way to far flung australia it is a narrative that beggars belief the simplest explanation of course is that there never were any moderates and that the united states and its allies precisely as renowned journalist seymour hersh warned in   went about raising a regional army of sectarian terrorists to fight an unprecedented proxy war with the predictable outcome being an orgy of genocide and atrocities also as warned by hersh in his prophetic article in fact hershs report would also state robert baer a former longtime cia agent in lebanon has been a severe critic of hezbollah and has warned of its links to iranian sponsored terrorism but now he told me weve got sunni arabs preparing for cataclysmic conflict and we will need somebody to protect the christians in lebanon it used to be the french and the united states who would do it and now its going to be nasrallah and the shiites what if not acataclysmic conflict could isis current regional campaign be described as and hasnt it been lebanese syrian iranian and iraqi shiaa along with many secular and enlightened sunnis who have come to the aid of those targeted by isis the evidence is overwhelming when considering us support for terrorists and extremists in places like afghanistan in the  s or even as recently as today with us support ofmujahideen e khalq mek it would be difficult to believe the us was not involved in raising and directing a proxy army against multiple regimes it openly seeks to supplant ultimately whether one pallet drifted into isis hands by accident in a recent airdrop is a moot point billions in cash weapons equipment and vehicles have already been intentionally supplied to the many groups that isis represents as planned as early as   isis is the purposeful creation of the united states in its pursuit of regional hegemony in the middle east and isis atrocities were predicted long before the first shots were fired in   in the syrian conflict long before the term islamic state went mainstream tony cartaluccis articles have appeared on many alternative media websites including his own at read other contributed articles by tony cartalucci here

4,the dalai lama has several times in his speeches called these pro democracy activists abroad representatives of the chinese people because he knows these people although having chinese faces actually oppose the communist party of china cpc and the chinese nation against this backdrop several so called friendship associations between the han chinese and the tibetans already set up are supported by the tibetan government in exile these associations are in reality platforms for the collaboration of extremely few separatists and they serve as a political mouthpiece for the dalai group scheme behind slogans of democracy freedom since the dalai lama and his supporters fled abroad   years ago they have learnt to use words such as democracy freedom and human rights to gloss over or sweeten their separatist nature in the dalai lamas words they are trying to build a united front for justice and truth and only when various ethnic groups including han tibetan and uygur people unite to set up a democratic front can they finally push forward democracy for the entire chinese nation the dalai lamas call was positively responded to by some pro  democracy activists abroad with leaders of activist groups paying visits to him recently the dalai lama seems to have forgotten not long ago he claimed that he sought to solve problems within the framework of the chinese constitution and was willing to improve relations with the central government the imminent conference on tibetan and han chinese issues in europe will discuss key issues including tibets future and chinas democratization according to the dalai group and a conference of the resresentatives of the chinese pro  democracy activists will be held later in the northern indian hill town of dharamsala according to a joint announcement by pro democracy activists the dalai lamas personal secretariat and the foreign affairs ministry of the tibetan government in  exile the agenda for the congress will include formally acknowledging the dalai lama as the spiritual leader of the so called china democratic movement forming a unified leadership and preparing to return to china for its regime to take over it is now clear that the so called democracy and freedom have been finally reduced to the objective of overthrowing the cpc leadership and the peoples democratic regime splitting the peoples republic of china to enable this small group of people to come to power more
3,being health conscious makes you the new conspiracy theoristbernie suarez the propaganda began at least a century ago accelerated after the creation of the cia and became more pronounced targeting american people after the jfk assassination as described in cia document     specifically the techniques which we see employed today all the time by mainstream media and cia assetsonline trolls include today of course we need only to remove the references to jfk in this document and insert the current issue of the time and this document comes to life nicely remember government and its globalist masters sit around and have meetings to decide what topics will fall under the banner of conspiracy theory and which will not to anyone wide awake its much simpler to understand it this way if a story or accusation interferes with the final new world order plans then its a conspiracy if it doesnt then its a different point of view or a debate the first thing everyone should understand about conspiracy theories is that you dont get to decide what topics fall under this category they do and because they government decide weve now seen the subjective fictitious propaganda based definition of conspiracy theorist morph dramatically over the last few decades as mentioned before we were first led to believe that conspiracy theorists were lunatics in basements separated from society claiming things that were not proven while actually being wrong about everything these people were supposed to have been essentially mentally diseased the conspiracy theorist then evolved into anyone who questioned    or any other new world order related false flag event for years cias mainstream media had worked hard to give the perception that conspiracy theorist represented a tiny percentage of americans but as the years went by millions all over the us and the world started waking up and now the government and its media mouthpiece started feeling the pressure the dilemma was and still is how to portray this growing number of awakened individuals  conspiracy theorists as an insignificant small group of people while at the same time adding more and more people to the group by deliberately expanding the topics that make you a conspiracy theorist the dilemma of this situation was finally addressed by cias newsweek in a desperate article by kurt eichenwald may of   entitled the plots to destroy america in the article eichenwald with seeming foreknowledge of the measles vaccine dilemma that was coming later in the year as a result of cdc whistleblower dr william w thompsons testimony admitting the measles vaccine link to autism in african american children had this to say about the measles exposed vaccine eichenwald rolls on explaining as can be seen the article identifies such a wide spectrum of beliefs under the new conspiracy theory umbrella that one might suspect this could arguably represent     of americans the list is long and includes anyone who doesnt agree with agenda   common core the bin laden death hoax the dangers of cell phones and more so many are the topics that the average american could and would potentially find at least one belief to agree with on the list thus officially making them a conspiracy theorist the only strategy eichenwald and the cia fall back on is the notion that yes we admit a lot of people are suffering from the mental disease of conspiracy theories translation waking up and because this large amount of people who are waking up are starting to represent a possible majority they are a danger to america translation the new world order plans thus in this article the globalists and their cia approved writer are on the one hand admitting that everyone is waking up while at the same time still appealing to their audience that essentially everyone is crazy and dangerous but you can still be normal by obeying this is proof that a lot more people are awake than the media is willing to admit sadly the ongoing agenda of cias mainstream media and government is not letting up by any means in   and beyond as can be seen by the media almost psychopathic attack on those who want to seek a healthy lifestyle we are regularly now seeing those who dont want to ingest fluoride into their bodies accused of being conspiracy nuts anyone who understands the compounds in vaccines admitted by the cdc and doesnt want those toxins to go into their body is now a conspiracy theorist nut anyone who doesnt want to eat genetically modified organisms and damage their own dna or even take the chance of damaging their own dna is now a conspiracy theorist just the element of not having faith in corporate cronies and dirty lying corrupt politicians is enough to get you on the conspiracy theorist list the definition of conspiracy theorist has in fact reached new levels never imagined by the average person simply wanting to eat only natural food and not take in any known toxins into your body of any kind above and beyond vaccines according to cias mainstream media and government is enough to get you labeled as a conspiracy theorist nut yes we are finally reaching a point in history where it is almost officially impossible to not be a conspiracy theorist unless you agree to being poisoned this is what happens when a state who has open plans for a new world order and massive stated depopulation goals can control reality with their ministry of truth propaganda media if there is anything good to take from all this it is that with stupid moves like this the corporate media will hopefully turn more and more people against it obviously everyone wants to live a happy healthy life why would we not if there is even a tiny chance that genetically modified foods and vaccines with known toxins in them could harm you why would we not want to exercise our own personal judgment on whether or not we want this for our kids our loved ones and ourselves reason for hope the pure insanity of the new world order psychopaths is truly upon us and we are seeing them in action in real time so many of us are awake and we all know we will never go along with any of this monkey business our duty is therefore to continue waking up as many people as possible our voices are strong and getting stronger every day while their voices the mainstream media are dying spread the word tell your family and friends that they are all conspiracy theorists if they believe in health lets make sure this is the hopefully final intelligence blunder of the globalists the blunder of thinking they could take over our own bodies tell us what to eat and even what to inject into our own bodies hopefully the magnitude of this personal psychological insult will be the final straw to break the new world orders back hopefully humanity is observing reading learning and taking notes we are all now getting a blueprint for tyranny weve seen all the steps in slow motion we now know all their moves lets take advantage of this bold yet ridiculous expansion of conspiracy theorist and see how far we can take the awakening process this time most important of all lets not forget that this battle of information does have an ending date perhaps this is the beginning of the end for the orwellian empire of deceit that seeks permanent world power bernie suarez is an activist critical thinker radio host musician md veteran lover of freedom and the constitution and creator of the truth and art tv project where this first appeared he also has a background in psychology and highly recommends that everyone watch a documentary titled the century of the self bernie has concluded that the way to defeat the new world order is to truly be the change that you want to see manifesting the solution and putting truth into action is the very thing that will defeat the globalists
4,no jobs no recovery it may seem counterintuitive but with the government reporting stronger than expected economic growth at the end of last year now is the time to think about renewed recession    and to act to avoid it the economy grew at an annual rate of    percent in the fourth quarter of   but well over half of that growth came from large adjustments to business inventories that are unlikely to be repeated on a similar scale in the months to come as such they are evidence that the sick economy is recovering not that it is healthy another chunk of growth was due to government stimulus spending which will wane in   much of the recent upsurge in business purchases of equipment and software was likely due to a rush to take advantage of an investment tax break before it expired in december so what does it take to translate an incipient recovery into a sustained expansion in a word jobs employment leads to income and to spending as sales deplete inventories businesses restock which creates more jobs and so on in an upward spiral unfortunately with the economy already some   million jobs short there is no job growth on the horizon robust enough to set that upward spiral in motion and because the economy is already in such a deep hole a second leg down would mean ever worsening hardship the house has already passed a bill that is a good starting point for creating jobs but the senate is sitting on its version with republicans and a handful of democrats arguing that deficit reduction is more important than jobs in the medium term the deficit is a serious problem but right now there is no way to sustain a recovery unless millions of jobs are created soon    and the private sector alone cannot do that in his state of the union address president barack obama said that he too was worried about the deficit and as a sign of good faith he committed to cuts in federal discretionary spending starting in the upcoming budget the senate can show its good faith now by passing a jobs bill ideally this week a good final bill would combine the obama administrations call for tax credits for hiring and incentives for small business lending with sound features from the house and senate versions it would contain the houses vital provisions for extending unemployment benefits and providing more aid to states without such aid states will have to make even deeper budget cuts    laying off large numbers of their own work forces and forcing their private sector contractors to do the same a final bill should also include provisions from the house and the senate to create infrastructure jobs and public service jobs and it should adopt the senates plan to create jobs that foster energy efficiency obama said he wanted a jobs bill on his desk without delay getting a good bill passed will be a crucial test of his ability to lead lawmakers including members of his own party where america needs them to go it happened in our backyard we sympathized with the concerns about security and inconvenience raised by the justice departments plan to try khalid sheikh mohammed the self described    mastermind at a federal courthouse in downtown manhattan a short walk from ground zero but caving in to political pressure and agreeing to move the trial as the times reported the obama administration has decided to do was the wrong move new york was the right place for this trial this is where the attack occurred and new yorkers should have been proud to see justice done here the us district court in manhattan has a long successful record of trying terrorists including the ones responsible for the   world trade center bombing president barack obama was right to move mohammed and four other high profile terrorism suspects out of the jurisdiction of military tribunals president george w bushs decision to hold prisoners outside the law and then attempt to try them in rigged military courts was legally wrong and hugely damaging to american values and this countrys global image mayor michael bloomberg first supported the presidents decision to hold the trial in new york but reversed field after looking at the costs of what could be a very long process local business leaders protested as did politicians with a variety of motives    none really sound and some profoundly cynical obama should have worked with the mayor to develop a security plan one that limited local disruption the federal government should have paid any additional cost it will have to do that wherever the trial is held the trial must remain within the federal court system obama should not put it in a makeshift court on a military base and definitely should not give in to demands from the right to return mohammed and the four other prisoners to the tribunals trying mass murderers in a criminal court is not soft on terrorism the federal courts have tried convicted and imprisoned many terrorists the tribunals have not held a single trial and may never have one that americans can be proud of for some republicans this is really about keeping guantanamo open others just want to block whatever obama wants rep peter king republican of new york has a particularly insidious bill that would obstruct justice by stopping the government from spending money on federal court trials for terrorists dianne feinstein the california democrat who heads the senate intelligence committee warned that holding the trial in new york would only heighten media and public attention that one baffled us this trial would draw attention if it were held atop pikes peak and isnt the idea of a public trial a bedrock principle of american justice holding the trial in new york would be inconvenient democracy makes demands on its citizens it is inconvenient to serve on a jury too this was just not in my backyard ism nearly   years after    it is sad if this country cannot freely conduct its business in lower manhattan climate change and the sec there were predictable howls after the securities and exchange commission told publicly held companies they should warn investors of any potential effects from climate change on their bottom lines rep joe barton among the most reliable of the oil gas and coal industries many friends in congress complained that the commissions time would be better spent on investor protection rather than imposing new burdens on corporations and promoting the social agendas of environmental groups investor protection is exactly what the commission had in mind when it decided by a     party line vote to add global warming to the list of material issues    plant closing the sale of assets    that companies may have to discuss in their financial filings mary schapiro the chairman said the commission was not adding new legal requirements but simply offering guidance to help companies decide when and whether to discuss the potential impact of global warming on their operations and earnings it makes good sense to us that companies should disclose whether a new law or international treaty limiting greenhouse gas emissions is likely to require new investments or increase operating costs a climate change law could also help companies that produce renewable fuels or environmentally friendly technologies like wind turbines that too should trigger disclosure the commission which took pains to say that it was not expressing an opinion on whether the worlds climate was changing has long required companies to reveal financial or legal impacts from other environmental challenges    potential liabilities under the superfund law or the clean water act for instance it has also been petitioned by investor groups and environmentalists to add climate change to the list of those challenges at the same time ordinary stockholders and state insurance regulators have begun expressing increasing alarm about the potential cost of unchecked climate change for american businesses the sec action is simply one more incentive for investors and managers to better understand the risks    and the opportunities    out there for publicly traded businesses super bowl censorship the commercials during the super bowl a showcase for the best or worst in tv advertising often generate buzz and sometimes outrage this year viewers will see one ad that has already triggered a heated debate about abortion and censorship the   second spot financed by the conservative religious group focus on the family is said to recount the pregnancy of pam tebow mother of the college football star tim tebow after falling ill during a mission to the philippines she ignored a recommendation by doctors to abort her fifth child who became the   heisman trophy winner the national organization for women naral pro choice america and other voices for protecting womens reproductive freedom have called on cbs to yank it their protest is puzzling and dismaying a letter sent to cbs by the womens media center and other groups argues that the commercial uses one familys story to dictate morality to the american public and encourages young women to disregard medical advice putting their lives at risk    a lame attempt to portray the ad as life threatening others argue that even a mild discussion of such a divisive issue has no place in the marketing extravaganza known as the super bowl the would be censors are on the wrong track instead of trying to silence an opponent advocates for allowing women to make their own decisions about whether to have a child should be using the super bowl spotlight to convey what their movement is all about protecting the right of women like pam tebow to make their private reproductive choices cbs was right to change its policy of rejecting paid advocacy commercials from groups other than political candidates after the network screens ads for accuracy and taste viewers can watch and judge for themselves or they can get up from the couch and get a sandwich

3,the race for raqqa   could two world powers meet in battle over isis hqby brandon turbeville raqqa has acted as the isis capital since the mysterious appearance of the group two years ago and has gone virtually untouched as the syrian military has been bogged down in major cities and westerncentral areas of the country in their fight against the western backed terrorists notably despite its rhetoric of fighting to degrade and destroy isis the us led coalition has yet to bomb raqqa fresh on the heels of a major public relations victory in palmyra however the syrian military is now marching toward raqqa and if successful it will score one of the biggest victories in the five year war this is not only because the de facto isis capital will be eliminated or because the saa will gain more territory it is because the liberation of raqqa will be yet another example of how the syrian military will have accomplished in weeks what the united states and coalition members have claimed may take a decade to do it will be another instance where the lack of will on the part of the united states to actually destroy daesh is put on display for the rest of the world either causing the us to look weak in the eyes of the world or exposing it for actually supporting the terrorist organization to begin with regardless the victory for the syrian government will be twofold that is unless the us gets there first     the us has been using the presence of isis in syria as an excuse to bomb send special forces publicly support terrorists and possibly invade since the western backed terror group appeared on the scene two years ago yet despite its rhetoric the united states and its coalition have not bombed raqqa and have largely abstained from bombing see here and here any other terrorist group instead the us has focused on bombing syrian military targets civilians and civilian infrastructure see here also and acting as a deterrent to the syrian militarys movement in many rebel held areas of the country now however the united states seems to have great interest in raqqa as it aids its loose collection of terrorists fanatical kurds and arabs known as the syrian democratic forces sdf in battles around the isis capital so why the sudden interest in raqqa its fairly simple the united states sees clearly that the syrian military and its russian allies are going to liberate raqqa soon enough and the us does not want to suffer another public relations setback a defeat for isis is thus a humiliation for the united states that fact alone should raise some eyebrows regardless the united states would like to have its own victory in raqqa before the syrians and the russians can have theirs if the sdf is able to take raqqa the us will then be able to shout from the rooftops that america has liberated raqqa and defeated isis in its own capital the us also has another goal in raqqa the theft of more syrian territory by using its proxy forces going by the name of the sdf whether or not isis proper is in control of raqqa is merely a secondary concern for the united states if the sdf succeeds in imposing control over the city and the province then the west will have succeeded in cementing control over the area in the hands of its proxy terrorists once again but with yet another incarnation of the same western backed jihadist fanaticism the us can then use the moderate rebel label to keep russia and syria from bombing the fighters who merely assumed a position handed to them albeit through some level of violence by isis with the situation as it stands there is now the very real possibility of some type of major confrontation taking place in raqqa that could very well have international ramifications on one hand there is the syrian military backed by the russian air force and russian special forces heading east to raqqa while on the other side there is the sdf backed by the us air and special forces heading west toward raqqa both sides are in a race to gain control over the isis capital gain territory and declare a victory for the world to see but what if they arrive in raqqa at the same time in other words there is a distinct potential that in the race for raqqa the syrianrussian alliance might find itself face to face with the possibility of direct military conflict with the ussdf terrorist alliance at that point the question will be who if either will back down if both forces decide to push forward the result could be devastating not only for syria but for the rest of the world regardless of what happens it is important to remember that the syrian military is acting entirely in self defense both against the terrorists posing as rebels and the united states russia iran and hezbollah have all been invited in to syria acting legally and with the assent of the syrian government while the united states and its coalition are once again acting completely outside of international law in an attempt to shore up its terrorist proxies and once again the united states and its coalition of the willing is pushing the patience of the rest of the world brandon turbeville article archive here is the author of seven

3,nyc mayor to force vaccinate under  s with two dangerous vaccineschristina england according to the statement of basis and purpose these vaccines are needed because children serve as a major source of transmission in communities the statement says in other words the mayor believes that all under five year olds attending day care facilities should be vaccinated with both the flu vaccine and the pneumococcal vaccine to protect herd immunity   not only is this policy irresponsible and a total waste of taxpayers money especially when there are far more pressing issues affecting the lives of children living in the us today but it is also highly dangerous is he unaware that in   there were    million children living in extreme poverty in america it has now been estimated that every   seconds an american child is born into poverty surely providing adequate food and shelter for hungry children would be more beneficial than force vaccinating them with yet more useless and dangerous vaccines which according to my research may not even be not even be compatible   i will discuss the vaccines incompatibility in full later in the article they state that half of all flu shots still contain quantities of mercury wildly in excess of maximum daily exposure limits set by the fda a forty pound four year old child injected with a mercurycontaining flu shot would be exposed to more than   mercury considered acceptable for an adult   on october     the healthy life reported that the flu vaccination fluzone marketed this year to seniors in the us was said to have been responsible for the death of   seniors in the original trials they wrote dr mercola made it very clear last year that fluzone given to seniors had proven to be exceptionally dangerous he reported that according to the cdc there had been frequent reports of side effects after the high dose fluzone vaccine dr mercola wrote dr mercola continued by also quoting what was written on the package insert he wrote that a total of    percent of seniors injected with the regular fluzone vaccine experienced a serious adverse event compared to    percent of those receiving the high dose version he said that according to the package insert the saes reported during the post approval use of the vaccine include despite knowing that this vaccine has caused the above side effects the us government once again recommend this vaccination to elderly people again this year it is not only the seniors who have suffered last year the flu vaccine was also said to be responsible for the death of a healthy seven year old girl who went for an annual check up at her local doctors office and received the flu vaccination the next day she was reported to feel unwell with a fever and a headache and she died in her mothers arms just a few days later   the nasal vaccine can cause a healthy child to get flu symptoms the latest flu vaccine for children is the nasal vaccine flumist this vaccine has also been reported to cause adverse reactions according to medicinenetcom the most common side effects of flumist are cough runny nose nasal congestion sore throat headache restlessness muscle aches tiredness or weakness and fever   in other words you take your perfectly healthy child for a vaccine to prevent them from catching the flu and it is highly possible that the vaccine they receive could give them the exact symptoms you were trying to avoid does not really sound like a good option does it no safety studies done on combining flumist with pneumococcal vaccines another worrying fact that medicinenetcom has reported is that there have been no studies related to administering flumist concurrently with inactivated vaccines they stated the pneumococcal vaccines are inactivated vaccines and therefore if they are given alongside the nasal vaccine flumist there is no way that parents the mayor the government or the manufacturer will know whether it is safe or not   page three of the statement of basis and purpose stated this indicates that the mayor has suggested that both the intramuscularly administered vaccine or the nasal vaccine could be used without even checking if they were both compatible with the pneumococcal vaccines in fact i doubt that this concern was even considered as a possibility by the mayor when he decided that children as young as six months should receive both vaccines before attending day care facilities surely before recommending that the government mandate a combination of two vaccinations for the under fives or anybody else he should check whether or not the two vaccinations that he is recommending are actually compatible members of the public who will be attending this meeting should be made fully aware of this important and possibly life threatening oversight by the mayor and also the fact that according to the cdc pneumococcal vaccines can lead to adverse reactions including high fevers low blood pressure loss of consciousness and anaphylactic shock before a vote is made on this policy   voice your concerns now to attend this meeting and give your views on october     you will need to contact roslyn windholz secretary to the board of health new york city department of health and mental hygiene at       extension   the meeting will be held from    am to mid day at new york city department of health and mental hygiene gotham center      th street  th floor room     long island city new york to pre register to speak at the hearing contact roslyn windholz at the address or phone number above before october     the department will also consider written comments about the proposed amendment written comments must be received by the department on or before the date of the hearing written comments can be mailed to roslyn windholz at the address above they may also be submitted by e mail to resolutioncommentshealthnycgov or posted electronically without attachments at either httpwwwnycgovhtmldohhtmlaboutnoticeshtml or through nycrules at wwwnycgovnycrules   conclusion surely unless the mayor of new york city is a qualified doctor or scientist he should not be recommending the force vaccination of children as young as six months no matter how good his intentions are especially since the two vaccinations he is recommending are possibly completely incompatible with one another and could possibly lead to multiple child deaths in new york city and across america this is absolutely unforgivable and in my opinion he should be severely reprimanded for his actions i suggest that the public of america join forces and either attend this meeting in person to voice an opinion or send emails as suggested it is only right that as many people in america on both sides of this argument are heard in full references
4,bobby thomson died last week and roger clemens was indicted no juxtaposition could better capture the way we used to feel about our sports heroes and the way we feel about them now clemens is just one of the many baseball superstars credibly accused of using performance enhancing drugs but the red sox turned yankee ace has achieved a particular infamy because he keeps obdurately denying it    to fans to reporters and finally and fatefully to a congressional committee other athletes have apologized beaten their breasts and tried to move on but not clemens a mercenary figure during his career in retirement the pitching great has become an icon of celebrity entitlement and public dishonesty part lebron james part richard nixon if clemens embodies baseballs decline into sordidness and scandal thomsons death is a reminder of the height from which its fallen the shot heard round the world his pennant winning home run for the new york giants in the autumn of   stands as the crowning glory of baseballs golden age all the romance of a bygone american era hovered around that day it was the dodgers and the giants the new york of frank sinatra and marilyn monroe the american century at its peak and then there was the contest itself thrilling and improbable and perfect the art of fiction is dead red smiths famous account began reality has strangled invention only the utterly impossible the inexpressibly fantastic can ever be plausible again  that was sports at its best surely a day for honorable ballplayers not corrupt multimillionaires a day untainted by cheating or dishonesty a game reduced to a pitcher a batter and a single pitch    and the crackle of a radio man shouting the giants win the pennant except that cheating did taint thomsons famous shot for decades it was rumored that the giants amazing   stretch run    they made up a   game deficit to force the playoff with the dodgers    had been abetted by a sign stealing system devised by their manager leo durocher finally the truth leaked out for the last   weeks of the season and throughout the showdown with the dodgers the giants used a centerfield telescope and a complex system of signals to tell their batters what pitch was coming next in joshua pragers book on that pennant race the echoing green he asks an aging thomson    the kindest most modest man imaginable by all accounts    about the sign stealing and his immortal three run blast the conversations that follow are agonizing did he look for the signal on that pitch id have to say no more than yes thomson says then i dont like to think of something taking away from it then in a later discussion it would take a little away from me in my mind if i felt i got help on that pitch then finally my answer is no and a coda i was always proud of that swing somewhere waiting for his day in court roger clemens is probably telling himself similar things whatever the truth about the drugs he took or didnt take he wants to believe    and wants us to believe    that all his achievements all his wins and strikeouts belong to him and not to any secret advantage he obtained thomson was caught up in a team wide escapade whereas clemens drug related decisions were his and his alone but when we think about the outcast pitcher    and about the whole steroids scandal    we should keep their parallel stories in mind and perhaps judge modern athletes more leniently not because the steroids scandal wasnt distinctively ugly and distinctively devastating but its part of a pattern that runs back through all of baseballs past    through the amphetamines that veterans pressed on younger players the spitballs pitchers boasted about throwing and every other edge that athletes turned to in duress whats more we know so little even now about who used steroids and how often and how it shaped the game and for every clemens or barry bonds or mark mcgwire being held up for public flagellation theres doubtless a future hall of famer    or a scrappy beloved gamer    whose drug use is still as secret as the   giants sign stealing used to be what roger clemens wants    what hes recklessly pursued to the point where hes facing perjury charges and possibly jail    is what bobby thomson enjoyed he wants to be judged on what happened on the field where pitches are thrown and swings are taken and everything else fades into irrelevance we know too much to give him that but though he hasnt asked for it maybe we also know enough about baseball history to give him our forgiveness

1,most americans are going to pay a lot more for health insurance in   they also will pay considerably more out of their pockets for copayments prescriptions and satisfying large deductibles however the us health care system costs users more than medical care in other countries but people are not getting their moneys worth as levels of care lag behind what is offered in other western countries  love it or hate it the affordable care act aca did enable an estimated   million in the country to get coverage however the aca and market dynamics have made that care less than affordable for many they are in health plans that only pay for physicals and major medical expenses after a considerable deductible consequently   percent of american adults did not see a doctor when they needed one or failed to fill a prescription for financial reasons a comparable study in    before the aca health plans were introduced  showed   percent did not get needed care  americans have worse health and are less likely to seek treatment then in other wealthy western nations like the united kingdom australia canada and france this was according to a study published in health affairs by comparison only   to   percent in germany the netherlands sweden and the uk did not obtain care because of cost considerations  the   commonwealth fund international health policy survey was conducted by telephone they surveyed adults in those countries germany the netherlands new zealand norway sweden and switzerland this spring survey participants were asked about experiences with their health care system in terms of access quality of care and affordability as well as questions about their overall health  cost issues compared the cost of medical care and health insurance also affects americans ability to afford other things approximately   percent of the adults in the us surveyed reported hardships due to health care costs broken down   percent worried about affording nutritious food and   percent struggled to afford housing  caps on annual spending for medical care and subsidies for lower income adults and families help in the us however other countries make more of an effort to remove the cost barriers to care for example in canada the netherlands and the uk there are no medical plan deductibles or co payments for primary care the french exempt lower income adults as well as people with chronic illnesses from co payments and other cost sharing germany and sweden cap out of pocket spending far lower for those who are chronically ill  the us performed worse in nearly all the measures studied in comparison to respondents from all   countries researched only canada joined the us in one ignominious area more than one fifth of adults reported that having more than one chronic health issue such as heart problems asthma diabetes or arthritis in the us   percent had two conditions and in canada   percent did  changes to the aca are top priorities for the republic dominated congress and president elect donald trump this survey indicates however that health care affordability in the us lags far behind other westernized countries and costs continue to rise with the election over there needs to be a rhetoric free discussion on providing access to actually affordable care

3,the oil crash of   has the big banks running scaredby michael snyder today the price of oil has been hovering around   dollars a barrel and over the past   months the price of oil has fallen by more than   percent this is something that has many us consumers very excited the average price of a gallon of gasoline nationally is just    at the moment and on monday it was selling for as low as   cents a gallon at one station in michigan but this oil crash is nothing to cheer about as far as the big banks are concerned during the boom years those banks gave out billions upon billions of dollars in loans to fund exceedingly expensive drilling projects all over the world now those firms are dropping like flies and the big banks could potentially be facing absolutely catastrophic losses the following examples come from cnn for instance wells fargo wfc is sitting on more than   billion in loans to the oil and gas sector the bank is setting aside    billion in reserves to cover losses because of the continued deterioration within the energy sector jpmorgan chase jpm is setting aside an extra   million to cover potential losses in its oil and gas loans it warned that figure could rise to   million if oil prices unexpectedly stay at their current   level for the next   months citigroup is another bank that also hasa tremendous amount of exposure citigroup c built up loan loss reserves in the energy space by   million the bank said the move reflects its view that oil prices are likely to remain low for a longer period of time if oil stays around   a barrel citi is bracing for about   million of energy credit losses in the first half of   citi said that figure could double to    billion if oil dropped to   a barrel and stayed there for the moment these big banks are telling the public that the damage can be contained but didnt they tell us the same thing about subprime mortgages in   we are already seeing bank stocks start to slide precipitously people are beginning to realize that these banks are dangerously exposed to a lot of really bad deals if the price of oil were to shoot back up above   dollars in very short order the damage would probably be manageable unfortunately that does not appear likely to happen in fact now that sanctions have been lifted on iran the iranians are planning to flood the world with massive amounts of oilthat they have been storing in tankers at sea iran has been carefully planning for its return from the economic penalty box by hoarding tons of oil in tankers at sea now that the us and european union have lifted some sanctions on iran the opec country can begin selling its massive stockpile of oil the sale of this seaborne oil will allow iran to get an immediate financial boost before it ramps up production the onslaught of iranian oil is coming at a terrible time for the global oil markets which are already drowning in an epic supply glut just the other day i explained that some of the biggest banks in the world are now projecting that the price of oil could soon fall much much lower morgan stanley says that it could go as low as   dollars a barrel the royal bank of scotland says that it could go as low as   dollars a barrel and standard chartered says that it could go as low as   dollars a barrel but the truth is that the price of oil does not need to go down one penny more to have a catastrophic impact on global financial markets if it just stays right here we will see an endless parade of layoffs energy company bankruptcies and debt defaults without any change junk bonds will continue to crash and financial institutions will continue to go down like dominoes we are already experiencing a major disaster things are already so bad that some forms of low quality crude oil are literally selling for next to nothing the following comes frombloomberg oil is so plentiful and cheap in the us that at least one buyer says it would pay almost nothing to take a certain type of low quality crude flint hills resources llc the refining arm of billionaire brothers charles and david kochs industrial empire said it offered to pay    a barrel friday for north dakota sour a high sulfur grade of crude according to a corrected list of prices posted on its website monday it had previously posted a price of     the crude is down from    a barrel a year ago and    in january   while the near zero price is due to the lack of pipeline capacity for a particular variety of ultra low quality crude it underscores how dire things are in the us oil patch a chart that i saw posted onzero hedge earlier today can help put all of this into perspective whenever the price of oil falls really low relative to the price of gold there is a major global crisis right now an ounce of gold will purchase more oil than ever before and many believe that this indicates that a new great crisis is upon us the number of barrels of oil that a single ounce of gold can buy has never ever been higher all over the planet big banks are absolutely teeming with bad loans and to be honest the big banks in the us are probably in better shape than some of the major banks in europe and asia but once the dominoes start to fall very few financial institutions are going to escape unscathed in the coming days i would expect to see more headlines like we just got out of italy apparently italian banks are nearing full meltdown mode and short selling has been temporarily banned to me it appears that we are just inches away from full blown financial panic in europe however just like with the last financial crisis you never quite know where the next explosion is going to happen next but one thing is for sure the financial crisis that began during the second half of   is raging out of control and the pain that we have seen so far is just the beginning michael snyder is a writer speaker and activist who writes and edits his own blogs the american dream and economic collapse blog follow him on twitter here bwahahahaha fools fools all of them those who refused to see the fallacy of being able to create unlimited amounts of bookkeeping entries fiat paper currencies and not having to deal with any ill effects when you have a system of unjust weights and measures it always always always kills itself off i was considering helping them along by taking my money out of the bank you can do what you want to i wont lift a single finger to stop you just realize that what you take out of the bank isnt really money at all just some fiat paper currency of no known or provable value if you use that paper to get something that you feel will be able to serve you later on down the line well great and welcome to the club and keep in mind that capital controls are only going to get worse the longer you delay i am aware and am prepared in every way possible my prayer is that those of the american people are doing so as well you dont take your money out of the bank oil has dropped by a factor of nearly   from its high of  bbl the only other commodity i can remeber dropping this order of magnitude was silver from a high of about  ounce the silver crash was quickly blamed on market speculators yet oils crash is blamed on supplydemand has there ever been another commodity price drop of this magnitude that was due to supplydemand rather than speculators oil reached a high of   per barrel at its height and now down to     this shows me just hoe badly rigged this oil market really is  if there was a shortage previously to force the price so high how come there is now such a glut to force the price down so low  it is not natural for any market to swing that much but oil is the basis for the whole financial system and i dont think anyone foresaw this did they  putin did what a brilliant christian man when he and trump team up it will be the end of the new word order jeckyl island schemers for a long long time we can rewrite the hunger games series and have the bush clan vs the klintonobamanite clan payback is a beeyatch thats a good point william the system we are controlled by was never really broken it was designed that way the elite will come out on top though they always do however all the money in the world wont save them from our wrath the real wrath will be the wrath of god which will destroy all evil and subject it to the second death eternity in the lake of fire everyone who has studied the bible seen it coming it is very informative and everything is written i have been telling people about markets collapsing since   the year when i found out how the fiat paper currency financial system is really set up all it took was a little bit of logical reasoning to see what the point of ne plus ultra was which is a complete crash of all fiat currencies in every country none will be spared just as all of the religions of the world can be shown to be dependent upon fraud of some kind to exist so too are all of the monetary systems on earth and elsewhere if there is an elsewhere no one can show me even just one little corner of the world where no fraud exists dare you evil low lifes try that too big to fail bail out schem again the deep state is trying to provoke russia into a shooting war now thats where the real money can be made
3,the potemkin village in new orleansjeff berwick contributor where to begin there was the fawning praise and worship of the military as the nations heroes as if these people werent the otherwise unemployable tools of foreign aggression and dominance even going so far as to have an ad that stated without the military thered be no super bowl i nearly snorted my beer out my nose on that one then there was the shameless display of kids from sandy hook i guess being put on such display before the nation at the great games was considered a suitable way to help heal the emotional wounds of the youngins who survived the tragedy it looked suspiciously like callous propagandizing and tear jerking to my jaded eyes however youd think that a country that gobbled up the hunger games books and movies in the last year would find it at least a little revolting to see children offered up for viewing like that amidst all the state propaganda and just before a form of gladiatorial combat the sandy hook choir was joined by jennifer hudson of course her mother brother and nephew were killed in a shooting in   i was all but expecting them to lower the corpses of her family members from the rafters as the encore im not the only commentator in the liberty world who will make the observation that the super bowl is just one of the many circuses to go with the bread doled out by the collapsing ussa empire but something else really struck me about the super bowl recently its not just about the entertaining distraction or even about propaganda in its hype and glitz its like a potemkin villagean attempt to convince the hundred or so million people falling into possibly permanent poverty that everything is just fine that the us is still a rich country on the verge of economic recovery after a temporary bad spell caused by a few greedy capitalists and not central banking and that the violent criminals running their lives have everything well in hand with the best interest of the people at heart so sit back relax and watch these millionaires tackle each other and the entire over the top spectacle so i do have a problem when what should be a free market pageant of the freakiest human athletes is instead used to help create a potemkin village the term potemkin village comes from an apocryphal tale of grigory potemkin erecting fake settlements along the dnieper river in order to make russian empress catherine ii known as catherine the great believe that things were going much better with the crimean campaign against the turks than they really were the story of these false settlements are said to be as accurate as the stories of catherines sexual appetite for horses that is to say they were a deliberate twisting of real events spread by enemies catherine did have a healthy sexual appetite as grigory potemkin one of her many lovers would know the veracity of the story of the potemkin village is debated with some experts claiming that the story is entirely a myth either way grigory potemkin and his villages have slipped into our language as denoting something fake built up to impress and to hide the complete lack of anything underneath which brings us back to the super bowl such a mighty effort to show wealth unity strength and then the lights went out amidst this big money eating pageant something as basic and symbolic as the lights staying on the whole time couldnt be managed thats what they get for holding the super bowl in a third world communist country though i was almost wishing the lights would stay out for a few more hours and we could watch in hd a remake of hurricane katrina in the superdome but this time with rich people my more philosophical and poetic friends tell me that the gods are drawn to hubris because they like cutting prideful people down to size so maybe they were watching this years super bowl and decided it was time for a slight hiccup in the proceedings maybe giving a small easily dismissed warning that the whole facade is going to come down and reveal the moral and economic emptiness just beneath     it may not be the wisest thing to shrug off a subtle message from the gods if they are indeed suggesting that the jig is just about up shouldnt you be making your plans accordingly if getting out of dodge and getting ready to annul your marriage to the ussa isnt on your immediate lists of things to do at least make sure you can get the best economic and actionable advice possible to thrive as the economic reality in the us can no longer be covered up by bread and circuses jeff berwick is the editor in chief of the dollar vigilante linkwithintextrelated articles

4,we are awash in constitutional proposals some sensible eliminating the legislatures two thirds vote requirement for passing a budget or raising taxes abolishing term limits some not enacting a flat tax in this spirit of reinvention then permit me a few modest queries why in the world do we have a two house legislature what does the state senate do that the assembly doesnt and vice versa in the name of fostering transparency ending gridlock curtailing backroom deals and creating a more responsive government why doesnt california just abolish the senate and create a larger assembly time was when the assembly and the senate in california and every other state but one nebraska has had a unicameral legislature since   were actually organized along separate lines    the lower house by population the upper house by geography just as each state regardless of size had equal representation in the us senate so state senates were organized to give counties regardless of population roughly equal representation as cities grew however rural areas were over represented and cities under represented often by absurd margins in the early  s los angeles county then home to   million people was accorded one state senator democrat richard richards as was one rural county then home to just    people indeed while richards alone represented   million californians the other   senators combined represented    million but in   in the case of reynolds v sims the us supreme court ruled that apportioning a state legislature into numerically unequal districts unconstitutionally violated the principle of one person one vote henceforth both houses of state legislatures were to be organized along identical lines the raison detre for bicameral legislatures ceased to exist and how many states confronted with this sudden redundancy of elective bodies moved to consolidate their two houses into one you guessed it none abolishing an entire category of elective office proved as repulsive to small government conservatives as it did to big government liberals the result in california today is two functionally indistinguishable bodies senate districts of which there are   are twice as large as assembly districts of which there are   but both kinds of districts have grown so large    senate districts are home to just under   million californians assembly districts to just under a half million    that election in either kind of district requires a multimillion dollar campaign with term limits members of the assembly once initially elected can count on serving three two year terms senators serve two four year terms assembly members then are not really closer to the grass roots than senators nor are senators particularly more experienced than assembly members the chief distinction of the senate is that it can offer assembly members a congenial district to run in once theyre termed out of the assembly and vice versa some termed out state senators have then moved on to the assembly so why not consolidate the two bodies into a larger one that reduces the size of the current districts if the new assembly had   members each would represent a little more than    residents    and because there are already   members of the legislature this could be done at no additional cost to taxpayers eliminating one house would also eliminate the possibility of behind closed doors mischief in the bicameral conference committees that now convene to reconcile the two houses versions of the same bill but why stop there in both sacramento and washington our governments have become all checks and balances with no discernible forward motion the two thirds vote requirement in the state legislature and the filibuster in the us senate create a form of minority rule that thwarts attempts to keep government responsive to changing social needs and negates the consequences of elections california needs a government capable of expanding not decimating the worlds greatest public university and of ensuring the health of its children not throwing them off the rolls one move that could foster such a shift would be to change the post of governor from a directly elected one to a prime ministerial one a californian would become governor when his or her party or coalition of parties attained a majority in the unicameral legislature state government would actually have a common purpose and the capacity to further its goals such a move would run counter to the american tradition of the separation of powers but as our public works and services fall behind those of european and other nations with parliamentary systems its time to question how well such a separation really serves our country and our state in the competitive global economy of the  st century it would be a bold move and i remember a california that used to do bold things meyerson is editor at large of the american prospect and an op ed columnist for the washington post
3,darpas autonomous microdrones designed to enter housesnicholas west this has been the promise that the air force made quite clear in their video early last year about nanodrone tech that you can see below according to the usaf micro air vehicles mavs combined with the ability to harvest energy will enable insect sized drone swarms to be dropped from military aircraft to stay aloft for a prolonged amount of time offering a host of functions including assassination darpa is now announcing a new wave of these microdrones under their fast lightweight autonomy program as the name indicates they ideally would like humans to be completely removed from the control process darpas press release below clearly states overseas as the theater of operation but it doesnt take much imagination to see how these microdrones could be applied in the us especially amid an increasingly tense urban environment in the wake of confrontations with domestic police and as always the tantalizing application in disaster relief paves the way for easy introduction my emphasis added in press release  darpa aims to give small unmanned aerial vehicles advanced perception and autonomy to rapidly search buildings or other cluttered environments without teleoperation military teams patrolling dangerous urban environments overseas and rescue teams responding to disasters such as earthquakes or floods currently rely on remotely piloted unmanned aerial vehicles to provide a birds eye view of the situation and spot threats that cant be seen from the ground but to know whats going on inside an unstable building or a threatening indoor space often requires physical entry which can put troops or civilian response teams in danger to address these challenges darpa issued a broad agency announcement solicitation today for the fast lightweight autonomy fla program fla focuses on creating a new class of algorithms to enable small unmanned aerial vehicles to quickly navigate a labyrinth of rooms stairways and corridors or other obstacle filled environments without a remote pilot the solicitation is available here httpgousagovmgwx the program aims to develop and demonstrate autonomous uavs small enough to fit through an open window and able to fly at speeds up to   meters per second   miles per hourwhile navigating within complex indoor spaces independent of communication with outside operators or sensors and without reliance on gps waypoints birds of prey and flying insects exhibit the kinds of capabilities we want for small uavs said mark micire darpa program manager goshawks for example can fly very fast through a dense forest without smacking into a tree many insects too can dart and hover with incredible speed and precision the goal of the fla program is to explore non traditional perception and autonomy methods that would give small uavs the capacity to perform in a similar way including an ability to easily navigate tight spaces at high speed and quickly recognize if it had already been in a room before if successful the algorithms developed in the program could enhance unmanned system capabilities by reducing the amount of processing power communications and human intervention needed for low level tasks such as navigation around obstacles in a cluttered environment the initial focus is on uavs but advances made through the fla program could potentially be applied to ground marine and underwater systems which could be especially useful in gps degraded or denied environments urban and disaster relief operations would be obvious key beneficiaries but applications for this technology could extend to a wide variety of missions using small and large unmanned systems linked together with manned platforms as a system of systems said stefanie tompkins director of darpas defense sciences office by enabling unmanned systems to learn muscle memory and perception for basic tasks like avoiding obstacles it would relieve overload and stress on human operators so they can focus on supervising the systems and executing the larger mission since the focus of the program is improving perception and reducing dependence on external sourcesas opposed to designing new small uavsdarpa will provide performers selected for the program with the same small uav testbed as government furnished equipment source darpa recently from nicholas west

2,questions rise after analyzing obamas birth certificate questions about president obamas true identity and origin have been circulating since his first term as in the white house while liberals are quick to dismiss claims that dont align with obamas story theyre also not giving us anything to support it to make matters worse the documents theyve attempted to provide have proved to be faulty now a new document has been released that proved that obama was not born in the united states according to a popular myth busting website the newly uncovered birth certificate states the following barack hussein obama ii general hospital mombassa kenya where obama was born a few hours later at    om on august     four days later his mother flew to hawaii and registered his birth in honolulu as a certificate of live birth which omitted the place and hospital of birth while no proof exists that this document is legitimate one thing is clear obama is spending millions of dollars trying to hide any concrete evidence either way that is the only real fact here and consider this if your country was trying to impeach you for falsifying documents wouldnt you do everything you could to prove them wrong it certainly makes you think

4,copyright   the washington post washington    defense secretary robert gates said in an interview broadcast this week that the united states would not repeat the mistake of abandoning afghanistan vowing that both afghanistan and pakistan can count on us for the long term in his first interview with the al jazeera television network gates said the united states made a serious strategic mistake by turning its focus away from afghanistan after soviet occupation forces were defeated there two decades ago as soon as the soviets left afghanistan we turned our backs on afghanistan and we did not cultivate our relationship with the pakistanis properly he said noting that us decisions at the time sparked doubts about americans commitment to the region i believe weve learned our lesson gates remarks come as he and other american officials weigh whether to deploy more us troops to afghanistan the defense secretary said he remained undecided on the issue there are issues on both sides of the argument and frankly i havent made up my own mind at this point in terms of whether more forces are needed gates said according to a transcript of his   minute interview gates was scheduled to meet with president obama on tuesday to briefly discuss the assessment given to him last week by the top us commander in afghanistan gen stanley mcchrystal pentagon officials said the officials added that gates has received comments on the assessment from senior military leaders including adm michael mullen the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and gen david h petraeus head of us central command and plans to present his own detailed views to obama later this week gates acknowledged in the interview with al jazeera that the heavier fighting and growing number of casualties in afghanistan have weakened public support for the war there is a sort of war awareness on the part of the american people gates said he added though that the possibility of withdrawal is out of the question the us military recognized as early as   and   that violence was escalating in afghanistan gates said but was unable to bolster forces there because of us troop commitments in iraq we have to speak frankly because of the troop commitments in iraq we didnt have the resources to move in reinforcements  as the situation in afghanistan began to deteriorate he said gates explained that he did what he could after taking office in january   extending one army brigade in afghanistan and adding a second brigade that spring that was really about all the resources that we had at that time he said as we have drawn down in iraq more capability has become available

3,things to show that you are not living in the land of the freeby paul a philips taking the case of america as an example many american citizens have no idea about the nature of their washington dc judas despotic leaders and how they are covertly screwing them all over how they are nothing more than henchmen for the ruling elites corporatebanker oppressive control system in reflection of this here are just   things to show that youre not living in the land of the free and what needs to be done the   hour working week is automatically accepted economically speaking you may be living comfortably but your request for fewer hours to pursue things outside of the workplace would be declined in other words youre given an ultimatum do a   hour working week or you wont get any work following on from   there are indeed many people having to do the   hour working week plus overtime on a skimpy hourly rate just to survive wage slavery refers to those having to be completely dependent on their next paycheck to make ends meet debt consumerism and inflation are major factors linked to wage slavery economic slavery and automatically accepting the   hour working week increasing in number these days there are so many authoritarian ordinances rules and regulations restricting freedom theres very little you can do without permission from your control freak government here are just some examples  do you own a property if so then having to forever pay property taxes brings into question the idea of ownership for example having lived there for some   years you may well have paid the same money in property taxes as the cost of your home  for home renovations you have to let your government know what youll be doing to get their permission then on completion you must make sure that youve complied with their regulations  if you want to sell your homemade produce no matter how small the cost youll have to pay for a license from the government  do you want to grow your own vegetables for supplementing your food budget if so then be careful you could be criminally charged then fined one man was fined for growing vegetables that prevented people from seeing grass if you go fishing for supplementing your food budget then youll need to have a license  your car is one of the many eternal taxes you will have to pay to your government indeed its as if the only thing that isnt taxed is the air you breathe but who knows maybe one day therell be a levy on that consider the shed loads of money the government makes from exponentially increasing ordinances rules regulations and taxes having not paid the necessary fees or taxes or not obtained a license or permit from the mafia government you could find yourself in big trouble not matter how petty or small the non compliance like for instance the children outlawed for selling lemonade at a charity then theres the case of the woman who had her home seized for missing a    interest charge mass surveillance is yet another way in which your freedom has been sabotaged by the government and related departments in spite of the increasing surveillance and a more and more militarized police state crime rates have not decreased indeed a number of us know that surveillance cameras here there and everywhere go way beyond the purpose of crime detection so do drone hunters monitoring applications such as your mobile phone activity spying electronic mosquitoes body micro chipping facial recognition and car number plate detection technology there are plans for a black box to be installed in every car to monitor drivers then theres a plan for a biometric dna database on all citizens these are just some of the surveillance technologies for a big brother control obsessed government the governments tyranny of free speech suppression just keeps on growing everywhere so called intolerable speech categorizations such as a trigger   micro aggression or red light is encouraged by authorities to be reported hence the encouraging of a snitch community weasel brained political correctness word prohibitions social media censorship all contribute to limiting free speech when free speech is limited it leads to a nation of citizens who are over christmas like a thief in the night obama sneakily passed a bill called the countering disinformation and propaganda act it gives the government the powers to label truthful and accurate information that they dont want you to know about such as that from alternative media sources as propaganda or fake news in effect this new law will be used to block free speech threatening the existence of alternativeindependent media or any other information source deemed anti government this globalist propaganda and the censoring of free speech in america must be stopped by this act is a desperate attempt one of many to stop the rising mass awakening of the people and the consequences of them finding out the truth but the more governmental tyranny the more the people wake up following on from   as a dissenter not having the same opinion as the establishment or the masses you may find yourself demonized for your views or actions which could even lead you into dire straits through being outlawed thus demonizing dissension especially because an anti government stance is becoming less tolerated criminalizing goodwill gestures is part of the war on humanity and your freedom of self expression here are just several examples another good samaritan criminalized for his compassion trying to make a difference to the plight of the homeless was jay hamberger because of helping the homeless for some   years in houston he became an outlaw further it is now illegal to be homeless how do authorities expect these impoverished people to pay the fines even their meager possessions bedclothes clothes tents papers medications are confiscated how could any policeman confiscating these possessions not consider this action to be inhumane will these outrageous prohibitions find their way across the entire country according to researcher michael snyder they will as part of the war on the homeless not too long ago an awful flooding occurred in louisiana because of a delayed response from the government backed rescue team locals decided to take the situation into their own hands however before they could deal with the rising waters and rescue their neighbors from the terrible consequences of the flooding government officials blocked off the area with police barriers because the rescuers didnt have the demanded permits aw cmon even the smallest acts of goodwill now demand that laws and regulations be followed do you want to exchange your home grown goodies with someone else you could be outlawed if you havent paid your government for a permit and taxes on the exchange that concludes just   of many things to show that youre not living in the land of the free clearly the government wants complete control they want you to be dependent on them for everything however the more control freak they become the more enforced prohibitions restrictions taxes police violence sophisticated surveillance and tracking technologies etc the more the people will object having reached breaking point thepeople will then decide theyve had enough while realizing that their government is and has been obsolete the government knows this and is desperately afraid of losing its grip on an overwhelming number of awakened citizens ready to take action more and more people are realizing the illegitimacy of big government the truth is we dont have any contract with them we dont need their permission to do anything taking thecase of taxestaxation is theft see video the solution is to stop giving your power away stop cooperating with the control system we are the imagination of ourselves and anythings possible so lets create a new paradigm experience a new humanity out of what is possible you can read

know that the masses can be run on the fantasy of something for nothing and they are more than willing to continuously sell people the fantasy that they are getting something when in fact they are not most people that i know wished they could get a forty hour a work week many of the youthful folks i talk to are living at home and work more than two part time jobs i wish we could do away with the third party moderators who keep time censoring my comments proving to me that i dont have freedom of speech on this website i am tired of the alternative viewpoint that the faux conservative approach to righting the wrongs of our criminal fascist non system is the way to proceed in an arena that has already seen the shtf the alt view is it is still about to happen we need to awaken to the mindset of the alienmilitaryindustrialcomplex that is not your friend or protector the republicans and democrats are in the hands of the americangerman billionaires who run the central banking non system of the planet and are the gatekeepers of the reptilian overlords americangerman billionaires who run the central banking non system lol those are not american nor are they german you dont know your enemy

total chaos you have to start with a consumption tax then reduce on an other year basis to almost nothing government must be small in order to keep order the first priority is to end the fed and its strangle hold on dc regarding the   hour work week many people are unaware that an overtime bill has been passed by the house of representitives not onece but twice that would let employers not pay time and a half for hours worked above   hours the bill would let employers instead give employees days off its a bit involved but the bill can be viewed online if people are interested from the comments posted on the sites about the bill some government workers already are being paid this way and boy do they hate it what i do know about this overtime bill is that the first time it was passed by the house gw bush was in office and promised to sign it it died in the democrat controlled senate the second time it was passed by the house obama promised to veto the bill and it once again died in the senate i am not certain but i believe the senate by that time was controlled by the republicans believe me when i say that i have no love for obama nor democrats i have posted on this site and other sites that barack hussein obama is the worst president in my lifetime and one of the very worst in us history he is a war criminal along with boy bush and should be tried as such he is dishonest to his core divisive and tyrannical boy bush was pretty much the same just a horrible horrible person and president thats just an opinion take it as that what is much more important and what worries me and what should worry all americans is whether this overtime bill will be resurrected in a trump administration all three branches of government are repulican disorganized as it may be will it pass the house it has before will the senate finally take it up and pass it that would then put the squeeze on trump to sign or face a possible veto that would certainly show where his loyalties lie if this bill is once again debated and becomes more well known it could be a very interesting and dangerous time for our country even warren buffett is richricher thanks to taking his share of the publics funds all of the military industrial complex is richricher for taking a major share of the publics funds if you surveyed the wealth of   of the   you would find the same thing as for the other   you would find the sale of booze during the prohibition and the sale andor transportation of slaves as the cornerstone of their wealth our prime concern should be in our personal financial progress instead of pointing fingers to the past which wont help us in the future poor people dont have power those without power cannot defend freedom  thanks for your opinion i beg to differ poor people who are educated and articulate who speak with understanding and knowledge can be very influential that most humans worship money prestige and power lie behind your words it is a place of great emptiness its a place of greater opportunities  a mans mind may be likened to a garden which may be intelligently cultivated or allowed to run wild but whether cultivated or neglected it must and will bring forth if no useful seeds are put into it then an abundance of useless weed seeds will fall therein and will continue to produce their kind james allen in as a man thinketh youre a crazy person you are maybe using a combination of words their robot doesnt like  or a link  americas freedom is a hoax we are not even close to being free the problem is those who visit this site and can benefit from the information offered are already aware those who are unaware wont see this we are either preaching to the choir or talking to the wall this is the essence of the dilemma we face global central banks have declared war upon humanity but those who have been highly propagandized and socially engineered cannot grasp it i believe we will now find out if the number of humans who are awake are sufficient to survive the global banks by withdrawing from their power base fakefiat currency since they can devaluedebase their global currency system and are doing so as i write this will there be sufficient

4,the following is a brief roundup of selected local newspaper editorials thursday apple daily cabinet must resign en masse premier liu chao shiuan is scheduled to announce a new cabinet lineup sept  he said the reshuffle will involve a bit more than just small changes that implies that he himself will not remain in the cabinet and that the number of ministers to be replaced will be more than one or two but perhaps just three or four the scale of the reshuffle is of course decided by president ma ying jeou and the decision betrays his teams collective conservatism ma and his ruling kuomintang have conventionally insisted that taiwans constitution prescribes a cabinet or parliamentary system under such a system a cabinet must resign en masse to assume political responsibility if its approval rating drops to a certain level or if the party loses major local elections the current cabinets approval rating has slumped to a new low in a series of public opinion polls because of its flawed response to the devastation wrought by typhoon morakot in early august against this backdrop the cabinet has no excuse to stay on and should resign en masse president ma can then name a new premier who could then pick a new cabinet those who performed well in the current cabinet can be re appointed while those who failed to fulfill their duties should be dropped thats what should be done in a democratic cabinet system if there are only small changes in the cabinet as liu has indicated this would be deeply discordant with the results of the public opinion surveys the current cabinet is a very homogeneous team like ma and liu the members have the characteristics of underlings they tend to be extremely cautious conservative resistant to change and short on innovation and creativity ma and liu both prefer to recruit academics to their teams and dare not employ outstanding local government chiefs or entrepreneurs because they would not know how to lead such people we hope the current cabinet will resign en masse and the new one will have as few scholars as possible university professors tend to reserve their academic posts and return to school after serving two or three years in the cabinet this leads to a lack of commitment to government and leaves the administration without competent ministers who can bring new thinking to its ranks and lead administrative reform liberty times taiwan would fare better if china refuses to sign ecfa china has threatened to defer the signing of a memorandum of understanding on financial supervision cooperation and a comprehensive economic cooperation framework agreement ecfa with taiwan because president ma ying jeou allowed the dalai lama to visit taiwan as a matter of fact china has already retaliated by canceling planned visits to taiwan by its provincial governors and procurement groups and by cutting back on the number of chinese tourists allowed to visit taiwan since ma took office in may   all of his policy proposals have been geared toward his ultimate goal of having taiwan reunify with china in line with its open door policy his administration has allowed an exodus of taiwan companies to china and has opened up taiwan to chinese capital these double bleeding measures are hollowing out taiwans economy official statistics show that after just one year taiwans unemployment rate has risen to more than   percent the actual number of unemployed people is likely to present an even more dismal picture worse still the economy is forecast to contract   percent this year from   while family income has been declining steadily and exports continue to shrink if taiwan signs an ecfa with china it would only deal a further blow to local industry and the economy as a whole therefore we believe if china decides not to sign such an accord with taiwan it would be a god sent gift that would be welcomed by many ordinary local people history is often full of ironies chinas threats of retaliation over the dalai lamas visit could be just a saber rattling tactic to tighten its control of mas administration but if those threats materialize they would serve to expose chinas true colors and result in a suspension of mas china leaning policy if that happens it would be a blessing for the people of taiwan rather than a tragedy united daily news beijing should not go too far beijing should try not to overdo its response to the dalai lamas latest visit to taiwan mainstream opinion in taiwan on the event is crystal clear    no one should use the tactic of inviting the tibetan spiritual leader to taiwan in order to sabotage the budding ties between the two sides of the taiwan strait the majority of taiwan people would not like to see warming cross strait ties undermined as a result of the visit therefore beijings reaction should not be one of retaliation against president ma ying jeous administration or penalization of the opposition democratic progressive party dpp beijing should instead look squarely at mainstream opinion in taiwan and refrain from going overboard as such an approach would only draw a backlash from or alienate the taiwan people we have repeatedly reminded beijing that taiwan is a vibrant democracy thats why the dalai lamas visit took place and thats why the waves it created will soon settle the main concern of the taiwan people regarding cross strait engagement is that beijing could employ a retaliation and punishment tactic to arbitrarily suspend bilateral exchanges which could lead to taiwans suffocation we believe that beijing would be not so foolish as to use the dalai lamas visit to stage a drill for its carrot and stick approach the furor over the dalai lama visit is just a tempest in a teapot but if it results in deeper public suspicion in taiwan toward beijing because of chinas overreaction it may take forever to mend cross strait ties china times revive passion for baseball to heal public wounds after the aug   flooding that was triggered by typhoon morakot the people of taiwan need a common inspiration to regain peace of mind and hope for the future we believe baseball can serve as that inspiration to restore the taiwan peoples confidence in the future some recent events can help to revive the publics passion for baseball which is reputed to be taiwans national sport first the kuei shan little league team returned to this years world little league competition after many years in williamsport pennsylvania in late august although the team finished second to the americans in the   little league world series it has won recognition for its skills dedication and spirit and has revived the passion of many middle aged people for little league baseball because of taiwans diplomatic isolation the annual little league series used to draw an outpouring of patriotism from taiwan people at home and abroad in the  s and  s meanwhile brother elephants the most popular team in taiwans chinese professional baseball league is celebrating its  th anniversary this year we congratulate brother elephants on their lasting popularity and longevity we hope they can contribute more to the development of taiwan baseball which has had its ups and downs over the past years taiwan baseball suffered a blow after the national teams poor performance at the   olympic games when it was defeated for the first time by the chinese

4,in a memorable scene in willy wonka and the chocolate factory the   film gene wilder who plays an eccentric confectioner displays a piece of gum that changes flavor while being chewed replicating a three course meal by tasting first like tomato soup then roast beef then blueberry pie now stride the   year old brand from the cadbury division of kraft foods has brought the idea to life with the introduction of stride shift two gum varieties that change flavors called berry to mint and citrus to mint in a recent television commercial for stride shift by the new york office of jwt part of wpp a focus group of young people is gathered around a conference room table when a voice over an intercom tells them to proceed an actor begins to chew and awestruck says my gum just changed flavors then panicked he shouts whats happening to me prompting an actress to throw a glass of water in his face only to have her gum switch flavor and when she panics prompting someone else to throw water at her the scene shifts to a room of middle aged marketers who wince as they watch the chaos on a monitor misguided marketers and physical humor are recurring motifs of stride commercials to underscore the gums long lasting flavor earlier spots showed marketers tracking down consumers to force them to spit out their gum in one spot a chewer crossing the street while talking on his cellphone is suddenly butted by a ram and coughs up his gum at which point a stride van screeches to a halt and marketers dash out to retrieve the gum from the pavement tonally the ads are jackass meets the office said tom christmann an executive creative director at jwt sugarless gum advertising tends to highlight benefits like freshening breath and even whitening or strengthening teeth but stride forgoes such claims because it is less relevant to its target market of teens college goers and gamers said gary osifchin director of marketing at stride stride speaks to younger consumers who chew gum not for functional reasons but for emotional reasons osifchin said younger consumers have a disdain for the ordinary and they like to be snapped out of boredom according to cadbury gum consumption is highest among young consumers superheavy users who chew more than   pieces a week represent about   percent of those age   to   but that drops to less than   percent of those   to   cadbury with other brands including trident and dentyne hopes stride will help retain chewers who otherwise as one internal research document put it age out of the category early in the    billion sugarless gum market stride is the fourth largest selling brand with an    percent share of the market and   million in sales for the   weeks ending april   according to symphonyiri group a market research firm whose data does not include wal mart the third largest brand behind wrigleys orbit and second place trident is wrigleys   gum which was introduced in   both stride and   cut back on advertising in   with stride spending at    million down from    million in   and   gum spending at    million in   down from    million according to kantar media the   brand aims at consumers ages   to   according to paul chibe vice president of the united states gum and mint divisions at wrigley a division of mars while other wrigleys brands promote oral benefits orbit promises a just brushed clean feeling and eclipse incredibly fresh breath for   its about creating that great sensory experience that stimulates them chibe said the brands latest flavors react fruit and react mint claim to have a manna like quality because as marketing materials put it everyone experiences it differently a new   react commercial by energy bbdo in chicago part of the bbdo worldwide unit of the omnicom group was shot in the science fiction style of the matrix movies in the spot which will have its premiere on may   two women and a man sit side by side as a large mechanical arm squirts out an amorphous material which to one woman appears as the shape of a flower to the other woman as a hawk and to the man as an octopus the spots otherworldly aesthetic and the intrigue about the gums flavor are all about building that deep emotional relationship with consumers so that consumers are with you on a journey chibe said not everyone is onboard for that journey however gumalertcom a blog by two gum enthusiasts shannon spare and katie reilly has reviewed several   flavors favorably but reilly wrote in a review that the two new   react flavors were too enigmatic much like cousin bill who reintroduces himself at a family wake no ones quite sure how these flavors fit in the family she wrote similarly for stride the blog has lauded many flavors but not the latest stride shift varieties i guess technically it changes flavor but from the get go you taste both the mint and citrus reilly said in a telephone interview at the beginning its an orangey mint flavor and then its a minty orange flavor but orange and mint dont go together    no one wants to drink orange juice after brushing their teeth

2,obama orders police to detain conservatives for being extremists according to recent reports the house homeland security committee just approved legislation that grants dhs and fema more power to arrest those that they consider to be violent extremists the measure also calls for a new office for countering violent extremism with the overly optimistic hope that such an organization will prevent americans from turning into radical extremists and forming groups against the government in the face of mounting threats our government is doing far too little to counter violent extremism here in the united states chairman michael mccaul told reporters whether it is the long reach of international terrorists into our communities or the homegrown hate spread by domestic extremist groups we are all ill equipped to prevent americans from being recruited by dangerous fanatics of course those who are already opposing the bill include more than   different civil rights organizations that claim that there is no evidence supporting that pre crime prevention methods are successful the trajectory of the uks efforts shows how these programs can morph into outright censorship a letter from the group reads what do you think do you support the proactive measures to protect our country or is this going to be used as a weapon against conservatives and gun owners
4,that is the fear if somewhat overstated of some mexican officials especially in northern border states that serve as a mecca for underage american drinkers the mexican legislature has voted quietly to decriminalize the possession of small amounts of pot cocaine methamphetamine and other drugs an effort that in the past has proved highly controversial there has been less protest this time around in part because there hasnt been much publicity some critics have suggested easing the punishment on drug possession sends the wrong message at a time when president felipe calderon is waging a bloody war on major narcotics traffickers the battle between law enforcement authorities and drug suspects has claimed more than    lives in the last      years but it was calderon himself who proposed the decriminalization legislation his reasoning it makes sense to distinguish between small time users and big time dealers while re targeting major crime fighting resources away from the former and toward the latter and their drug lord bosses the important thing is  that consumers are not treated as criminals said rafael ruiz mena secretary general of the national institute of penal sciences it is a public health problem not a penal problem the legislation was approved at the height of a swine flu outbreak in mexico that dominated the publics and the worlds attention meeting at times behind closed doors    the better to prevent the spread of disease officials said    the lower and upper houses of congress passed the bill on the last days of april it awaits calderons signature the bill says users caught with small amounts    five grams of marijuana   milligrams of cocaine    clearly intended for personal and immediate use will not be criminally prosecuted they will be told of available clinics and encouraged to enter a rehabilitation program as many as   milligrams of methamphetamine a synthetic and especially harmful drug are permitted as are as many as   milligrams of heroin three years ago in may of   then president vicente fox from calderons right wing party vetoed a similar bill that congress had approved and that he initially had supported he backed down only under pressure from washington dc where the bush administration complained that decriminalization for even small amounts could increase drug use but with less than a month to go before critical mid term elections in which his party is struggling to maintain control of congress calderon cannot afford to be seen as bowing to the united states analysts say already under intense criticism for the drug related violence terrifying parts of the country calderon needs to maintain good relations with congress where much of the opposition voted in favor of the decriminalization initiative he cant suddenly go back on his own bill and so political observers say he probably will sign the bill into law calderons office did not comment for this article so far the us government has not publicly objected to the legislation michele leonhart the acting director of the us drug enforcement administration however told a news conference in april that legalization of drugs would be a failed law enforcement strategy for both the us and mexico mexican government officials stress they are not talking about legalization but decriminalization until now courts decided on a case by case basis whether and how to punish first time drug use offenders and standard criteria for quantities hadnt existed originally calderon wanted users caught with the permissible amounts to avoid jail time only if they agreed to rehab but the bill now says only that treatment would be encouraged then calderon sought a provision in which a user arrested a third time would be obliged to seek treatment that requirement was removed ruiz mena said after debate over whether mandatory rehab is ever effective mexico is woefully underequipped to handle a booming drug abuse problem for decades the country was a transit point for cocaine marijuana and other drugs headed to the us but more recently domestic consumption has soared a   study by the government found the number of addicts in mexico doubled in the previous five years drug abuse has gotten worse in part because some of the big cartels pay their people with cocaine pot or other such substances clinics and other institutions that specialize in treatment and prevention have not kept up with the trend the government is building   centers to improve care but experts say that is not enough the decriminalization legislation has received criticism from religious leaders and several officials of northern border states who fear that so called drug tourists will begin flocking to towns and cities already besieged by violence allowing the carrying of certain amounts of drugs will create more consumers oscar villalobos chavez social development secretary for the state of chihuahua which borders texas told local reporters an editorial in the official magazine of the roman catholic church criticized legislators for liberalizing the law when faced with the highly contagious and lethal sickness that drug addiction represents mary ellen hernandez director of the rio grande safe communities coalition in el paso texas across the border from the blood soaked mexican city of juarez said she worried decriminalization would lure americans into a drug world they arent prepared for and increase violence on both sides of the border already the drugs that dont come over into the us are being handed out by dealers to younger and younger children in mexico         year olds hooking them said hernandez whose agency specializes in drug prevention and then the youths steal to feed the habit optional add end except for a relatively few voices however there has been minimal protest over the law and some praise luciano pascoe vice president of the small left wing social democratic party said the law was a positive first step that helped shatter the stigma that consumers are criminals pascoes party is running in next months elections on a platform that includes legalization of all drugs as a way to make it a less lucrative business for traffickers it remains unknown whether that position had anything to do with four of his candidates being shot at and attacked in recent weeks none was seriously injured
2,wounded combat vet risks everything to go up against obama its hard to believe that obama has not been kicked out of the white house yet given his completely ignorant approach to foreign policy although his presidency is thankfully coming to a close soon we can almost be certain that we have not seen the extent of the damage he can cause now many americans are wondering what his next move will be of course we already know that obama has decided to move forward with his outrageously risky plan to let    syrian refugees into america in the next year republicans and democrats alike were shocked when the president did not alter his plan at all following the terrorist attacks in paris the red flags are flying everywhere and obama seems unwilling to see them isis has publicly stated that they intend to hide fighters in groups of refugees and weve seen this take place in other countries if they do move forward with this plan it will be virtually impossible for the united states to detect syria does not keep detailed records of their citizens according to the united nations approximately   of the syrian refugees that have crossed into europe so far have been military aged males this is ironic given that liberals are attempting to paint a story of orphans and widowed women obama is now actively working to destroy america as a country by bringing in terrorists to kill americans omar avila a veteran wrote we do not have an obligation to help terrorists the logic is undeniable avila concluded obama has now crossed the line obama is a traitor what do you think are you sick of obama putting americans second to his own agenda do you agree with avila
1,donald trumps deplorable supporters arent waiting for the election results to start spilling blood   theyve been threatening bloody violence ever since trump began claiming that the election is rigged in favor of hillary clinton and trump has called for them to intimidate voters at polling places   in texas last week a trump supporter was arrested for electioneering at a polling place because he was wearing one of trumps stupid hats and a deplorables t shirt to vote   election code prohibits any person from electioneering within   feet of a polling place   of course trump supporters threw a temper tantrum because they think the rules dont apply to them   well now it looks like they have retaliated by setting up a booby trapped trump sign at a polling place knowing that an official or volunteer would have to take the sign down   at collin college in plano texas a trump sign was discovered zip tied to an official polling location sign in direct violation of the election code that forbids electioneering at polling places   but when a volunteer went out to remove the sign they got a nasty surprise in the form of box cutter blades that were strategically hidden inside the blades sliced into the volunteers hands and drew blood requiring medical attention and prompting officials to order that signs be checked thoroughly before removal   it just shows how far we have come in politics where people want to be so mean and so hateful to try and injure somebody whos probably not got any political party persuasion one way or the other local democratic party campaign chair steve spainhouer said in response  i think most people have already made their minds up at this point how theyre going to vote and so theres nothing to gain by being mean spirited or hateful   heres the video via ktvt    frankly this should be considered an act of domestic terrorism trumps supporters have gone too far and it could get worse as election day approaches and if trump loses his supporters have already threatened to try to overthrow the federal government in a bloody coup   clearly these people are deranged and the safety of voters and election officials are in danger but you wont hear donald trump condemning this act of violence after all he is the one inciting it

3,prediction the day of economic reckoning is neardoug casey the gold report there will be a casey research summit on navigating the politicized economy in carlsbad california in september investors from around the world look to these summits as future road maps for investing pitfalls and opportunities the thesis behind the summit is that governments have made a faustian bargain a pact with the devil that saves the empire with overspending but drives it to the brink of collapse by creating fiat currencies doug where in that story is the economy currently doug casey its extremely late in the day since world war ii and especially since   when the link between the dollar and gold was broken governments around the world have accepted the keynesian theory of economics which boils down to a belief that printing money can stimulate the economy and create prosperity the result has been to create huge amounts of individual and government debt it has become insupportable all it has done is purchase a few extra years of artificial prosperity and were heading deeper into a very real depression as a result we have been consuming more than we have been producing and living above our means let me define the word depression its a period of time when most peoples standard of living declines significantly it can also be defined as a time when distortions and misallocations of capital things usually caused by government intervention are liquidated tgr will more quantitative easing qe give us another couple years of artificial prosperity dc most unlikely were at the end of the story not the beginning more qe i hate to call it that because its really just printing money i hate euphemisms words that are intended to make something sound better than it really is euphemisms like exaggerations are the realm of politicians and comedians anyway the next round of money printing is going to result in radical and rapid retail price rises there is no prosperity possible from this rather the opposite tgr last time we spoke you said that we are entering into a depression greater than in   can you describe how it might be different dc what we experienced in the  s was a deflationary depression where billions of dollars were wiped out with a stock market collapse bond defaults and bank failures inflationary money that was created since the formation of the federal reserve in   was wiped out prices went down this depression will be different because governments have much more power theyll try to keep uneconomic operations from collapse theyll prop them up as we saw with fannie mae and general motors theyll create more money to keep the dead men walking they wont allow the defaults of money market instruments they will make efforts to maintain the dollar mark on money market funds theyll attempt to keep building the pyramid higher its foolish indeed idiotic but thats what theyll do tgr which theyve been doing by printing money the first rounds of money printing have gone into the banking system but the banking system has not allowed it to trickle back out into bank loans does that open the possibility of deflation if money is not moving out into the general economy dc thats right the government created trillions in currency to bail out the banks the banks have taken it in to shore up their balance sheets but they havent lent it out because theyre afraid to lend and many people are afraid to borrow that currency is basically in treasury securities at this point although money has been created its not circulating i believe that governments have the power to create enough new currency to keep prices from going down at some point its going to move out one consequence of this is that interest rates have been artificially suppressed so that retail inflation is running much higher than interest rates are compensating for it at some point rather than sitting on hundreds of billions of dollars that are going to be inflated from under them the banks are going to do something with that money it will go out into the economy retail prices will start rising tgr do we need to see another round of money printing to put us over the brink into a collapse or will it happen even if they dont print more because its currently sitting in the banks dc they actually dont have to create more money its just a question of whether the banks start lending it and people start borrowing it another possibility is that the foreigners holding about   trillion outside the us get panicked and start dumping them i dont see any way around much higher levels of inflation unless of course we have a catastrophic deflation which we almost had with the real estate collapse tgr how much will europe play into this it seems its governments are at least according to the popular press more exposed to bankruptcy than the us government dc europe is a full cycle ahead of the us its governments and its banks are both bankrupt its a couple of drunks standing on the street corner holding each other up at this point europe is in much worse shape than the us its highly regulated highly taxed and much more socially unstable europe is going to be the epicenter of the coming storm japan is waiting in the wings as is china this is going to be a worldwide phenomenon of course the us will be in it too were going to see this all over the world tgr if europe finally does go over the brink where its been headed for more than a year would that also cause inflation in the us or would you expect to get catastrophic deflation dc this is an argument thats been going on for at least   years how is this all going to end catastrophic deflation or runaway inflation the issue is still in doubt although i definitely lean toward the inflationary scenario but will it start in europe how will it start these things only become obvious after they happen tgr when you say lean are you pretty convinced its going to be inflationary dc i think its going to be inflationary in the  s it was a deflationary collapse governments are vastly more powerful and much more involved in the economy now than they were then i believe that they have the power to create enough new currency to keep prices from going down somehow moronically theyve conflated higher prices with prosperity investors need to look for real productive wealth and consistent growth if we had a completely free market economy prices would constantly be dropping thats a good thing because as prices constantly drop it means money becomes more valuable that induces people to save money when people save it means that they are producing more than they are consuming thats a good thing the way governments have it structured today however prices are always going up that discourages people from saving because their money is constantly worth less which encourages them to borrow inflation induces people to try to consume more than they produce which is unsustainable over the long run tgr you are saying that if the current value of your money is higher than the future value that encourages borrowing dc exactly i dont see any possible happy ending to this were approaching the hour of reckoning tgr you have said that the titanic forces of inflation and deflation are fighting an epic battle that leads to extreme market volatility but i am looking out there this summer and thinking its pretty calm it seems like a very slow recovery gold is settling around   ounce the sp   index is testing the    mark is this just a pause in the epic battle dc nothing goes straight up or straight down i just took a cross country car trip from florida up the east coast to new york and then out to colorado it was actually rather shocking that many times i had trouble getting a motel room even in the middle of nowhere the restaurants were full the highways were full of cars it looked more like a boom than a depression at the same time our real unemployment figured the way they used to figure it in the early  s is about     people are living off their credit cards i believe its the same in europe tgr it seems as if we havent had much market volatility other than the technical glitch at knight capital this month do you expect market volatility to come back into play dc on the one hand some people are going to go into the stock market when inflation reasserts itself because at least it represents real value they can invest in companies that actually produce things and have real assets on the other hand the stock market itself by any historic parameter is overvalued right now in terms of dividend yields price to book value and price to earnings ratio i have no interest in being in the broad stock market i feel very confident that the bond market especially is going to be very volatile thats the one place where it seems that theres a real bubble and its one of the biggest bubbles in history its the worst possible place for capital right now its a triple threat higher interest rates default risk and currency risk even reading the popular press you can see investors in a desperate reach for yield theyre only getting a fraction of a percent in their bank accounts so to get some income they are buying all kinds of bonds even those of low quality just to get       or   in yield the bond market is trading at insane levels as a result of the government having driven interest rates down close to zero in a vain effort to stimulate the economy the bond market is much bigger than the stock market when interest rates start heading up trillions in bond values will be wiped out in addition to causing a lot of corporate bankruptcies thats why deflation isnt completely out of the question in addition higher rates could really further devastate the real estate market which has been making a mild recovery and of course higher interest rates are the enemy of high stock prices tgr one of the keynote speakers at the upcoming summit is thomas barnett author of the pentagons new map war and peace in the twenty first century hes going to be talking about geopolitics today and tomorrow from your viewpoint in todays age of nationalism and conflicts among nations is it important for investors to know about geopolitics in order to pick junior mining stocks dc most certainly very few investors are putting any money into the junior mining stocks right now which tells me that its a good time to start looking at them however investors need to have a grip on geopolitics in order to intelligently assess which companies to buy there are   nation states in the world and they all have different policies investors have to avoid putting money into a location where a company will never be able to develop a mine even if its lucky enough to find an economic deposit tgr as well as thomas barnett there are some very impressive speakers at the summit doug   speakers at the event who should be there for this event dc as we get closer to the day of reckoning it becomes critical that those who have something to lose meaning investors savers and homeowners are aware of whats happening and also what they can do about it were heading into unchartered territory i think this is so important that we are also recording the summit and making it available for download as soon as possible after the summit tgr you developed the concept of the   ps for stock evaluation typically you say that the people are the number one thing that you look at is politics starting to move up in importance as a determining factor dc people are still the most important because good people who are running a company will choose an intelligent jurisdiction to develop its also a question of whether the world at large is becoming more stable or less stable i think its becoming less stable because all the governments in the western world are really bankrupt and are therefore going to be looking for more tax revenue mining companies are going to be in its sights because mining companies cant move their assets they are the easiest thing in the world to tax the good news is that makes mining stocks very volatile and sometimes extremely cheap volatility can be your best friend but economically as things get tougher in the western world that will hurt the developing world too because it depends on marketing its raw materials if the western world is using fewer raw materials its going to put pressure on those developing countries tgr doug youre talking a lot about geopolitical unrest the world is becoming less stable in   i heard a lot of discussion about gold going into a mania stage specifically for many of the reasons were talking about now as we approach   will we run into that discussion of gold mania again dc its not likely to happen until we reach much higher levels of inflation and we have something approaching financial chaos but thats exactly where were headed and soon the mania is likely to be fear driven much more than greed driven gold is still in the climbing the wall of worry stage mania is still in the future its going to happen i feel confident of that theres going to be a rush to gold tgr one of the people you like to quote quite often is richard russell theres a specific quote ive heard you say a couple of times in a depression everybody loses the winner is the guy who loses the least in order to be that guy who loses the least is it a viable strategy to stay out of the markets dc its almost impossible to stay out of the markets because practically everybody has a pension program an investment retirement account or something of that nature you have to put the assets of that pension into something the stock market the bond market or cash most people own real estate or their home if the real estate market gets hurt you get hurt there if you have wealth what are you going to do with it its not a good option to put   bills under your bed even then youre in the market for currency thats one of the biggest problems with inflation it forces people to direct their attention to gambling in the markets as opposed to productive business there has been way too much concentration on the financial markets over the last   years this is shown by the fact that roughly   of the us economy is in financial services which is basically just moving money around the financial services business doesnt weave spin or sew it doesnt produce anything in a sound economy the financial services sector would be tiny just big enough to facilitate transactions it wouldnt be the mammoth that it is today it seems as if everybody is in the business of moving money around but the money theyre moving around is just paper currency its quite nonproductive tgr they are producing new financial instruments in a way financial services companies are coming up with alternative methods to build wealth dc i question that financial services dont actually build wealth real wealth is created by the production of new technologies food metal or products financial services serve a purpose of course but it isnt a real wealth creator today the sector is more of a moving paper fantasy even what i do which is advising people on where to allocate their wealth has always made me feel a little bit sheepish because im not actually building a bridge or creating a new engine or technology im just telling people how to move things around if the economy were sound   of the people in my line of work would be doing something else a speculator basically is someone who capitalizes on politically caused distortions in the market if we had a sound economy the government wouldnt be causing these distortions and it would be much harder to be a speculator anyway the whole financial sector is bloated by the time the bottom hits the last thing that people are going to want to hear about is the stock market the bond market or where to put their money theyre not going to want to read financial newsletters because theyre going to be so sick at the very thought of those things people wont ask how the markets are doing they wont even care if they exist theyre going to get back to the basics that is the foundation for the next boom but that time is a good many years in the future tgr but you are still in the business of helping investors move around assets what would you say to investors now on how they can protect or grow their wealth through the next phase of volatility dc we need to learn how to survive and profit in a market bogged down by crippling government regulations billion dollar bailouts excessive money printing and cronyism thats what the summit is all about but to be frank its very hard to be an investor in a highly politicized environment investors need to look for real productive wealth and consistent growth speculators on the other hand try to capitalize on the chaos that is caused by the myriad of destructive government regulations taxes and of course currency inflation thats why i look at all markets in all countries but right now there are very few bargains at some point for instance real estate is going to be of interest again not right now because governments everywhere are going to raise taxes on it tgr would you put things like technology pharmaceuticals and health care in the category of real wealth dc very definitely thats why we have a technology letter ive always been kind of a boy scientist technology interests me from an intellectual as well as a financial point of view technology is the real mainspring of human progress no question about that the problem with the medical industry is that its being nationalized its very hard to do anything with the us food and drug administration fda as it is it costs   billion to develop a new drug today developing medical devices can be almost as expensive even if something is approved by the fda if something goes wrong count on being sued by the plaintiff bar its a very high risk business which is a pity living longer and better physically is one of the most important things there is medical businesses should be encouraged not pilloried ive always said that the fda kills more people every year than the defense department does in the typical decade but boobus americanus still thinks its protecting him editors note read more about investing in the life sciences report tgr are there other areas for real or productive wealth dc i read science magazines all the time there are more scientists and engineers alive today than in all the history of the world put together hopefully with the continued blossoming of india and china where students are generally going into science and engineering as opposed to things like gender studies political science and english literature which students idiotically are doing in the west there will be even more scientists and engineers   years from now what areas are they going into nanotechnology microbiology robotics these things will blossom the way computers have over the last few decades the problem when it comes to investing in them is that theyre increasingly highly specialized investors need at least a sound laymans knowledge in order to know if theyre barking up the right tree or not and thats hard theres just not enough time in the day to gain enough expertise for this type of thing of course thats the value of magazines and newsletters the editors condense information for readers to give them an intelligent laymans opinion tgr now were back to the importance of people you do have to have some sense of the person who is doing that analysis for you it needs to be someone whos credible dc absolutely thats the advantage of having a newsletter over a magazine in a magazine you dont always know whats going into the sausage that that writer of an article is making when youre dealing with a newsletter you can get to know the editor what hes thinking how expert he really is and what is his psychology you can learn if you can trust his opinion although i read both magazines and newsletters newsletters are much more valuable tgr to bring this full circle i would imagine attending speeches summits and conferenceswhere you meet these newsletter writers or analysts face to face is also beneficial dc yes it gives you a smorgasbord of views its helpful in assessing the validity of the views to be able to assess the personality of the writer and have a better understanding of whether his views are actually credible and its a great opportunity to ask questions tgr doug youve given us quite a bit of your time i greatly appreciate it even if you cant attend the navigating the politicized economy summit you can still benefit from the information the   experts have to impart in the audio collection right now you can save   when you pre order the   hours of audio you can support this information by voting on reddit here

1,the cdc has issued guidance that instructs hospitals to list covid   as a cause of death regardless of whether or not theres actual testing to confirm thats the case  according to the cdc guidance even if the coronavirus was just a contributing factor or if its assumed to have caused or contributed to death it can be listed as the primary cause  the problem with making informed decisions about coronavirus is that we dont have a whole lot of data on it at the moment and the cdc guideance could skew the data in a significantly different direction  which in turn could influence the governments intervention to stop the spread of the virus  westernjournal report the international statistical classification of diseases and related health problems or icd has established the code u   for death by coronavirus infection theres a secondary code u   for clinical or epidemiological diagnosis of covid   where a laboratory confirmation is inconclusive or not available according to the cdc guidance  because laboratory test results are not typically reported on death certificates in the us nchs is not planning to implement u   for mortality statistics  therein lies the problem  the underlying cause depends upon what and where conditions are reported on the death certificate however the rules for coding and selection of the underlying cause of death are expected to result in covid    being the underlying cause more often than not the guidelines read  covid   should be reported on the death certificate for all decedents where the disease caused or is assumed to have caused or contributed to death certifiers should include as much detail as possible based on their knowledge of the case medical records laboratory testing etc the guidance continued  if the decedent had other chronic conditions such as copd or asthma that may have also contributed these conditions can be reported in part ii  author and former new york times reporter alex berenson one of the few well known figures to question some of the statistics on covid   questioned the new cdc guidelines as well    as you sit home watching covid death counts spiral please know the official cdcgov guidance for coding covid related deaths is as follows any death where the disease caused or is assumed to have caused or contributed to death confirmed lab tests are not required pictwittercomh d mcti r  alex berenson alexberenson april        and btw other possibly relevant factors like oh copd are considered secondary the rules are expected to result in covid   being the underlying cause more often than not httpstcoo zulqht  alex berenson alexberenson april      earlier this week president donald trump and members of his coronavirus task force announced that they were expecting a death toll of between    and    from coronavirus  in an article on friday the washington post said some experts didnt think the white houses prediction models were accurate it wasnt because those experts thought that figure was too high or too low its just because they didnt think there was enough data to determine a death range yet  we dont have a sense of whats going on in the here and now and we dont know what people will do in the future jeffrey shaman a columbia university epidemiologist whose work was used by the white house to determine the death ranges said  we dont know if the virus is seasonal as well  it doesnt help that data when the guidelines for determining whos actually died of the coronavirus are profoundly vague  for instance what happens when an elderly person with numerous underlying conditions comes into the hospital and dies  what happens when someone suffering from late stage cancer or liver failure dies in the hospital if that person was in the final stages of life and no testing is done and no autopsy conducted what are we to assume  if no testing is done and a patients symptoms are close enough to the seasonal flu will that persons death automatically be attributed to covid   and how much of a difference would that make in the numbers if any  theres no doubt that this guidance will inflate the numbers the only question is how drastically  in places like new york city where medical professionals are painfully overstretched anyone who dies with an infection thats vaguely covid   like could potentially have covid   listed as their cause of death  consider for instance that the cdc is estimating there were between    and    deaths in the united states from influenza between october and march  in nyc does that mean some of those deaths got lumped under covid   will this keep on happening  if so that could skew the data in a significantly different direction  and it could influence the governments intervention to stop the spread of the virus  this is a haphazard way to gather data at a time when that data needs to be more accurate than ever we can and should do better than this

3,switzerland follows iceland in declaring war against the bankstersby isaac davis iceland has gained the admiration of populists in recent years by doing that which no other nation in the world seems to be willing or capable of doing prosecuting criminal bankers for engineering financial collapse for profit their effective revolt against thebanking class who drove the tiny nation into economic crisis in   is the brightestexample yet that the world does not have to be indebted in perpetuity to an austere and criminal wealthy elitein     icelandic bankers were sentenced to prison and the government ordered a bank sale to benefit the citizenry inspired by icelands progress activists in switzerland are now making an important stand against the banking cartels and have successfully petitioned to bring an initiative to public referendum that would attack the private banks where it matters most their power to lend money they dont actually have and to create money out of thin air switzerland will hold a referendum to decide whether to ban commercial banks from creating money the swiss federal government confirmed on thursday that it would hold a plebiscite after more than    people signed a petition calling for the central bank to be given sole power to create money in the financial system the campaign led by the swiss sovereign money movement and known as the vollgeld initiative is designed to limit financial speculation by requiring private banks to hold  pc reserves against their deposits the telegraph switzerland is in a key position to play a revolutionary role in changing how global banking functions in addition to being the worlds safest harbor for storing wealth it is also home to the bank for international settlementsbisa shadowy private company owned by many of the worlds central banks and acting as a lender to the central banks the bis is the very heart of global reserve banking the policy that enables banks to lend money that does not actually exist in their bank deposits but is instead literally created electronically from nothing whenever a bank extends a line of credit reserve banking is thepolicy that guarantees insurmountable debt as the outcome of all financial transactions the sovereign money initiative in switzerland aimsto curb financial speculation which is the intended and inevitable result of reserve banking the tool that makes financial adventurism possible by supplying the banks with endless quantities of fiat money limiting a banks ability to produce money from nothing would be a direct blow to the roots of the banking cartel and would cripple their ability to manipulate the world economy heres how it works in rather simplified terms if we had access to the same computer terminals the banks have we could magic in or out of existence all the imaginary stuff we are trained to think of as important money in whatever quantities we liked this is how it works when they print quite a lot of this stuff there is a boom when they print too much of it there is inflation actually the printing of money is inflation when they stop printing it or simply hold on to it there is a depression source in switzerland   of all money in circulation is electronic and for this the national bank of switzerland has become the direct target of the sovereign money campaign swiss law has in the past required required banks to back all currency creation with collateral assets like physical silver or gold however in recent decades the climate has changed and due to the emergence of electronic payment transactions banks have regained the opportunity to create their own money the grassroots campaignsaid in a public statementregarding the intentions of the referendum banks wont be able to create money for themselves any more theyll only be able to lend money that they have from savers or other banks this is an interesting twist in the human saga of man vs banks and while it remains to be seen if the referendum passes or not it must be pointed out that it does have its own problems articulated bysam gerrans it does say that the central bank should be given sole right to create money this would essentially leave the creation of money in the same hands as those who control the federal reserve or the bank of england rather than allow them to farm out the process but at least it shows that people are beginning to wake up to where the true power lies in the unlikely event that this grass roots movement in switzerland should get its way and its proposed legislation be enacted and then begin to morph into something which really does threaten the banking elite we must not be surprised if switzerland is shortly discovered to be harboring weapons of mass destruction or to have masterminded    or to be financing islamic state part of the cultural conditioning of our time is an ingrained presumed dependency on sacred cow institutions like banking just like it is impossible for most americans to envision a world without democrats and republicans it is difficult for most people to imagine a world without predatory global banking yet there are a number of other possibilities for trading storing wealth and facilitating development in the world this is not the only economic system we can imagine and as iceland has proven people can regain control of their collective wealth so perhaps this revolution will foment further in switzerland presenting a chance to at least bring greater awareness to the truth about central banking image credit isaac davis is an outspoken advocate of liberty and an honest society from the top down he is a contributing writer for wakingtimescom follow him on facebook here looks like some activists will be falling off buildings soon dont expect something like this to ever happen here in the us because the bankers own the government you dont think swiss bankers own the govt in switzerland they have for eons check it out its well known banksters need to go kudos to switzerland a much more humane system no usury yes thats the problem usury not fiat money the banks dont create money they create ious of money they do so whenever they make a loan digital money is an iou of real money notes and coins which is fiat money when a bank makes a loan it doesnt lend real money it adds the amount of the loan to the borrowers account this means that the bank owes the borrower that amount in real money in fact the borrowers account is part of the creditors side of the banks general ledger at the same time the bank creates another account in the name of the borrower with the same amount in it but with a minus sign in from of it this means that the borrower owes the money back this account is on the debtors side of the ledger and the world trades with these positive accounts these ious from banks to borrowers ie digital money now because this money wasnt issued by congress it is in fact counterfeit money and because no real money is actually lent to borrowers the bank doesnt risk any of its own real money but the bank pretends it has lent its own money or their depositors real money notes and coins and charges interest as though it had this is true usury not only because of the huge amount of interest charged up to double the principal in a typical housing loan but because the bank hasnt risked any of its own or of its depositors money clever trick huh these two ious and the lie that digital money is real money and the bank runs a risk of losing any real money because the borrower may not pay the loan back and that therefore it is entitled to charge exorbitant interest  and if you default on the mortgage no matter how long youve been paying the non existent money back for they get to take your home and sell it at another profit what a cracking con game banking really is and still nobody really knows agreed however i think you meant pier not pear which is a fruit what is wrong about a pair of pears that have no pier the fruits of missed keystrokes that have been pared off from achieving parity in this miserable world of piering perhaps too myopically into the world of spelling not pear pier i thought the swiss were the bankers the swiss federal government confirmed on thursday that it would hold a plebiscite after more than    people signed a petition calling for the central bank to be given sole power to create money in the financial system thats not reform what nation determined to live within its means ie balance the budget has need for anything other than a functioning treasury department such as existed in the us until wwi switzerland which wisely maintained neutrality in wwi and wwii but trained each citizen with military skills to ensure that it could unlike belgium enforce its neutrality had no need to become involved in the very wars that were historically the basis for central banking in the first place is the last place that need a parasitic central bank at all i like what switzerland and iceland are doing america needs to audit the federal reserve then shut it down its obvious the fed the executive and congressional branches spending are responsible for americas massive deficit and bankrupt economy lol the evil residence is there do think they are to let this go thru maybe for show but not for real it will be just buried in hidden legislation and go on as usual why do think they were neutral in so many wars to protect the banksters i cannot see the advantage of stopping the smaller criminals but letting off the biggest criminals if central banks are not stopped from lending money they dont have it is hardly useful only an elected government should be allowed to create money and even then not as much as to reduce the purchasing power of the currency its still a privately owned central bank who board consists of owners of the big corporate banks it will make no difference at all dont forget the swiss gold referendum and how that turned out there is one way that i believe we could get rid of the central bankers their reserve banking system without complete chaos setting in off course we would also need to build the president an underground bunker to reside in so that he doesnt meet the same fate as jfk over   years ago the great thinkerjohn dalberg actonlord acton was quoted as saying this must be a joke switzerlands banking system is the center of banking deceit thats where many of the banking elitists live lol did they not over time lobby to have the regulations relaxed and eventually done away with the world needs to do away with these gangsters who know fine well all political types can be bought
4,coup leaders have three days to reinstate deposed honduran president manuel zelaya or be expelled from the organization of american states the group announced in a resolution early wednesday oas members had debated launching a diplomatic initiative to resolve the crisis and oas secretary general jose miguel insulza delivered what he called an ultimatum as oas talks regarding the crisis dragged into the early morning hours the talks began tuesday afternoon the resolution vehemently condemned the coup and the arbitrary detention and expulsion of zelaya according to the associated press calling zelayas overthrow an old fashioned coup insulza said according to the ap we need to show clearly that military coups will not be accepted we thought we were in an era when military coups were no longer possible in this hemisphere the oas was also considering calling on the world bank the international monetary fund and the inter american development bank to cut off all loans to the honduran government meanwhile zelaya scrambled to hold on to his presidency pleading his case in the united states and winning a rare unanimous vote of support from the un general assembly but failing to get an audience with top obama administration officials in new york zelaya told the general assembly that honduras was reverting to the age of dictatorship repression has now been established in the country after the meeting he vowed to return to honduras on thursday with a delegation of dignitaries including the presidents of argentina and ecuador the secretary general of the oas and the president of the general assembly diplomats tried to persuade zelaya not to make the trip some analysts worried that the crisis could be escalating if he zelaya goes back with no one laying the groundwork  its going to be a huge clash said jennifer mccoy director of the carter centers americas program who attended an urgent oas general assembly on the matter zelaya was detained by soldiers sunday morning and expelled from the country a close ally of populist president hugo chavez of venezuela zelaya had clashed with the honduran congress the military and the supreme court over his plans for a referendum that many alleged was an effort to change the constitution in order to gain another term as president the us government continues to recognize zelaya as president rather than a replacement sworn in by the honduran congress roberto micheletti but the obama administration did not grant zelaya a high level meeting at the white house or state department state department spokesman ian kelly said secretary hillary rodham clinton could not meet with zelaya because she was away from work recuperating from a fractured elbow this is just something that came up today he said of the hondurans decision to fly to washington but the low key treatment of zelaya appeared to reflect an effort by the obama administration to preserve some room for diplomatic maneuver the us government is working with regional leaders to resolve the crisis but it has outsize influence with the honduran elite because of its close military ties and its economic clout zelaya was expected to meet with the assistant secretary of state for western hemisphere affairs thomas a shannon jr and the top latin america official on the national security council dan restrepo during his stay in washington if zelaya felt slighted he didnt show it asked about allegations from some leftist politicians that the united states favored the coup he said i have listened to president obama it is not only that he condemns the event but he has demanded the restoration of the president i have also heard the ambassador of the us in tegucigalpa he has taken the same position against the coup powers the un general assembly unanimously condemned the coup yesterday afternoon and demanded the immediate and unconditional restoration of the legitimate and constitutional government of zelaya the action while not legally binding provided a show of unity at the united nations in responding to an international crisis bringing the united states together with stridently anti american governments in latin america such as cuba venezuela and nicaragua zelaya took to the general assembly podium to condemn the coup as an act of barbarity by a small group of usurpers in a lengthy address he portrayed himself as a champion of the poor who had been brought down by a clique of conservative military and economic elites who resented his attempts to improve the living standards for impoverished hondurans he denied allegations that he had prepared the referendum to pave the way for another run for president saying he planned to step down after his mandate ends in january he added that the new governments allegation that he had engaged in wrongdoing was unfounded i have been accused of being a populist ive been accused of being a communist he said but added that he had not had an opportunity to defend himself nobody has told me what my crime is what my error is he said zelaya presented a detailed account of the army raid on his home saying he had been rousted from his sleep by gunfire and confronted by soldiers as he sought to alert a local reporter and others on his cellphone lynch reported from the united nations

4,tampa everyone knows what they say about first impressions but if that saying were true then there probably would be no point in having defensive tackle dre moore on the buccaneers roster his debut as a   fourth round draft pick was so forgettable he didnt even make the final roster instead he was reduced to the practice squad along with mostly undrafted prospects it was a surprising result given the rave reviews the organization gave moore upon his arrival referring to him as an interior pass rusher in the warren sapp mold but a new coaching staff and a new focused attitude have combined to give moore an opportunity to change opinions and more important his fate ive been waiting for the better part of a year to make a second first impression moore said there are reasons the bucs think moore is different he is in dramatically better condition something that is evident by a glance his effort has improved  and football seems to rank higher on his priority list when i became the head coach i had a heart to heart with dre said coach raheem morris promoted to his post in january we went in my office and i told him i did not like him very much last year but i said im willing to look at you for you this year i told him to go out there and get better and hes done that i see effort hes giving me everything hes got hes showing some splash plays hes still got miles to go but the jump from last year to this year man its not even close the bucs plan to use moore in their rotation of defensive tackles moore is probably trailing rookie roy miller for the third slot but wherever hes slotted its hard not to envision him making the team and playing important snaps thats a much different outcome from   i think the best thing that ever happened to dre was getting cut and being put on the practice squad defensive line coach todd wash said he knows how much that affected him as a football player and how we looked at him i kind of felt that he thought that being a draft pick he would have a place on the football team and he just went through the motions but now he knows its tough on the street so hes become more of a student of the game hes more focused in meetings i love the guy but sometimes he just was a slacker it took him more time to grow up but weve seen him mature and now were seeing the importance that football has to him moore said he was overwhelmed by everything last year from learning the playbook to living on his own in an unfamiliar city physically he points to his intense offseason work remaking his body as a key he looks downright svelte now morris said with a straight face that moore couldnt even do a pushup when he arrived in may   in part because of a shoulder injury suffered while at the university of maryland i wanted to be here and put the work in and i really put in a lot of work in the weight room said moore   i probably weigh   pounds right now but i feel good moore has made some head turning plays in the preseason including a quarterback hurry against tennessee that redirected kerry collins into defensive end stylez white for a sack but making up for that bad first impression will take more than a couple of highlights but i just want to ride whatever momentum i can get moore said what ill say is that i didnt pack it in after last year so im not going nowhere now

4,the taipei city government has encouraged the rebuilding of low to mid rise residential buildings in the city that are   years or more old through financial and technical assistance programs the move however has drawn questions and criticism from the ministry of the interior and lawmakers the critics have expressed doubts that the city governments plan can work and have claimed that it could on the contrary fuel the surging residential housing prices which are already too high however the plan is an innovative move that has imagination and guts given the fact that under a free and democratic system urban renewal in taiwan is a complicated constantly changing and hard to control process the makeover plan is worthy of support from the points of view of improving the capital citys overall look and elevating the quality of living for residents taipei is a rather unattractive city compared with other metropolises around the world the numerous old residential buildings    many of them built in the same period of time to a uniform design    not only make the city look tired but the outdated road system and utilities also prevent its residents from enjoying a quality of life equal to those in other modern cities the city governments makeover plan is worthy of central government encouragement and support as the plan will provide residents with an opportunity to renovate their own residences help facilitate a facelift for the run down looking metropolis and indirectly help arrest the spiralling housing prices better late than never but if the plan is procrastinated over for too long it will be too late for the city to rejuvenate itself april

4,japan teen sensation ryo ishikawa compared the horror conditions at the scottish open on sunday to the typhoons back home   after he was blown away in his final round the   year old hit an eight over   on a day of rain and high winds at the scenic par   course on sunday ishikawa had started the week with a promising   and looked to have a reasonable chance of becoming the youngest winner of this european tour event but as conditions worsened so did his scores   culminating in sundays weather that sent him an untimely reminder of back home the rain and wind were almost like the typoons in japan he said so it made it really difficult and it made it hard to play it was the worst i have played in i couldnt make any distance with my driver and the cross wind made it hard as the ball was pushed away it was conditions i wasnt used to playing in ishikawa began his day at three over and was keen to put in a good score to boost his confidence ahead of next weeks open championship at st andrews he started with two bogey fives but redeemed himself immediately with an excellent eagle three at the par five third but that was the only highlight of his day and further bogeys at the fourth eighth and ninth saw him reach the turn in   the youngster famously posted a   back in may and while that round was sprinkled with birdies bogeys were the order of day at loch lomond he dropped a further five shots in the closing nine holes to end the tournament on   over par and well down the leader board it was a disappointing end to the week   although the scoreboard was littered with scores in the high  s and  s   and he now turns his attention to st andrews when he makes his second appearance in the open last summer at turnberry he partnered tiger woods and again failed to cope with the scottish wind and along with the world number one bowed out at the halfway stage but he has shown this year that he can compete on the biggest stage and will go into next weeks event fresh from an excellent showing at last months us open he wowed the crowds at pebble beach and was tied for second after the second round before finishing joint  rd he will look to build on that showing at st andrews and is confident his experience at loch lomond will help him cope with anything next week throws at him he added this event will prepare for me next week i wont be surprised by any weather conditions now after that i am looking forward to it now i missed the cut last year and my first aim is to play the final two rounds i have played st andrews once before and the fairways were very wide it was interesting experience and im looking forward to going back
3,humans fully outsourced to robots by  nicholas west with the rise of automation a background debate echoes the idea of full spectrum human machine integration for those who might overlook the full theoretical endgame of the singularity including transhumanismand immortality the economic singularity is showing itself already the outsourcing of human jobs as a side effect of globalization has arguably contributed to the current unemployment crisis in the united states however a growing trend sees humans done away with altogether even in those countries where us jobs have landed as a fully robotic workforce takes over curiously by the same singularity date of   according to professor moshe vardi a rice university computer science professor so what does this mean for the future of human relevance robot proponents have often cited the brutal working conditions of factory labor inefficiency and corporate bottom lines as principal reasons for replacing humans human beings are slowly but surely becoming redundant in areas as diverse as manufacturing product fulfillment and even warfare however it is the rise of artificial intelligence which suggests that the former argument stating that humans could maintain positions requiring high skill and decision making may have been wishful thinking many computer science experts are beginning to conclude that complete human obsolescence in the workforce is a more likely outcome according to moshe vardi if current trends of computer development and human replacement continue the traditional labor market will be a thing of the past as a consequence of machine intelligence it is in the context of the great recession that people started noticing that while machines have yet to exceed humans in intelligence they are getting intelligent enough to have a major impact on the job market in their   book race against the machine how the digital revolution is accelerating innovation driving productivity and irreversibly transforming employment and the economy authors erik brynjolfsson and andrew mcafee argued that technological progress is accelerating innovation even as it leaves many types of workers behind indeed over the past   years as we saw the personal computer morph into tablets smartphones and cloud computing we also saw income inequality grow worldwide while the loss of millions of jobs over the past few years has been attributed to the great recession whose end is not yet in sight it now seems that technology driven productivity growth is at least a major factor such concerns have gone mainstream in the past year with articles in newspapers and magazines carrying titles such as more jobs predicted for machines not people marathon machine unskilled workers are struggling to keep up with technological change its a man vs machine recovery and the robots are winning source until this point as vardi notes humans have been competing with their own creations mainly at a level of brawn not brain yet that is where the most significant changes are taking place in computational ability giving rise to full fledged artificial intelligence which threatens to overtake even the areas of skilled labor as well as areas of traditional human to human services we can see signs of this in the following areas just to name a few it is also often cited by robot and ai proponents that humans are destined for a life of leisure as our creations take over in order to assist us with the grunt work so that we can live tranquil lives of creative pursuits and peaceful philosophical endeavors however this was a common argument also made when the personal computer came on the scene most of us would agree that the personal computer definitely offered us increased efficiency and productivity but only so that we could work more not less at this point it doesnt seem like the outsourcing of human abilities to our robotic counterparts is leading us toward the life of leisure that has been promised but instead is leading to the perception of humans as nothing more than a troubling quantity within a new economic algorithm how can we ensure that we maintain relevance during a time of such rapid change professor vardi offers the following as his concerns about leisure and human relevance first if machines can do almost all of our work then it is not clear that even   weekly hours of work will be required second i do not find the prospect of leisure filled life appealing i believe that work is essential to human well being third our economic system would have to undergo a radical restructuring to enable billions of people to live lives of leisure unemployment rate in the us is currently under   percent and is considered to be a huge problem technology always has been a double edged sword the possibilities presented by artificial intelligence and robotics hold massive positive potential that actually could challenge elite power structures in the meantime our economy is transforming away from human inefficiency and variability to a robot economythat is already showing itself as a threat to the viability of an increasing number of people without a massive paradigm shift in the ability for the average person to tap into the growing potential for a massive reduction in cost of goods and services while still maintaining control over their own creations the endgame is likely to be more grim than utopian we are living in an extraordinary time where we are at the cusp of a massive change that has not been seen since the industrial revolution in its potential to impact nearly every person on the planet please leave your comments about what you conclude will be the outcome other sources interview with moshe vardi related activist post articles read other articles bynicholas west

4,the iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad said wednesday that his nation would produce a higher grade of nuclear fuel on its own escalating its war of words with the international community over its disputed nuclear program his declaration continued a daily drumbeat of defiant proclamations from the iranian leadership which has vowed to expand its nuclear facilities and hone its capabilities to enrich uranium despite strong warnings from the united nations and western powers that its program violates its commitments under the nuclear nonproliferation treaty i declare here that with the grace of god the iranian nation will produce   percent fuel and anything it needs itself ahmadinejad told a cheering crowd in the central city of isfahan according to the reuters news agency iran claims it needs a relatively high grade of nuclear fuel for civilian uses but many in the west suspect its program is aimed ultimately at producing atom bombs uranium enriched to   percent can fuel a reactor and also marks the dividing line between what nuclear specialists call low enriched uranium and high enriched uranium at the   percent level iran could in theory make an extremely crude and heavy nuclear weapon the bigger threat would be that its enrichment could quickly accelerate from there to the much higher grade of fuel    enriched to   percent    typically used in modern nuclear warheads iran has said the   percent uranium is needed for a reactor in tehran that produces medical isotopes the country denies that it has any intention of developing nuclear arms and ahmadinejad has not threatened to turn its current stockpile of enriched uranium into bomb fuel but his new declaration came just days after iran angrily rejected demands that it shut down a once secret enrichment plant and instead vowed to build ten more ahmadinejad also announced that his cabinet would study what iran needed to enrich its existing stockpile of uranium over the past two months the united states and its western allies have offered to supply uranium enriched to   percent for the tehran medical reactor but only if iran shipped some of its current stockpile of low enriched uranium out of the country the deal brokered by the united nations with support from the united states sought to defuse tensions surrounding irans program iran with uranium enriched to   percent in the form of fuel rods for a reactor would then presumably have no cause for enriching more uranium on its own but iran effectively rejected the offer calling it a ploy by the west to confiscate its existing stockpile

3,subliminal messaging and predictive programming how they work and why some people are immuneby daisy luther this has been going on for decades these techniques are used to reduce resistance to upcoming tyranny to change opinions of large groups of people and let them think it was their own idea and tosubtly program the brains of the masses while they think theyre just enjoying some entertainment the only good news in this article is that some of us are less susceptible to this type of manipulation how do we become less susceptible by understanding how it all works we build up sort of an immunity we see when we are being subjected to these shenanigans a lot more readily and are able to say hey thats not how i feel about this topic at all there have been tons of articles and almost as many theories about predictive programming predictive programming is when events are depicted in a movie or tv show that later come to pass you can search and come up with hundreds of hits for movies and shows ranging from the sandy hook map in dark knight risesto the simpsons predicting the ebola outbreak and the death of princeoh and the author of the hunger games trilogy suzanne collins lives in sandy hook and her books deal with child sacrificesim just sayin weird right at least sometimes coincidences do happen for example in   morgan robertson wrote a novel called futility about a ship called the titan that hit an iceberg on its maiden voyage fourteen years later the titanic sank after hitting an iceberg on its maiden voyage you can read more about the similarities between the book and the real event here now in this case i really doubt that the author arranged for the white star line to commission a ship called the titanic and then had it sink in mid april after hitting an iceberg the first time it left port other forms of predictive programming arent so clairvoyant or specific but are predictive in that they reflect a way of life so why would they do this it is proposed that by mimicking a change that is desired by those in power resistance to that change can be minimized because people have seen it happen already its easier for them to accept the change because it has been normalized through the media here are a few examples from an article by the coincidence theorist the article goes on to link significant terror events like    and    as well as events like the moon landing its a really great piece until you get to the conclusion and he says its all baloney even after he provided a ton of interesting evidence to support the case of predictive programming as a tool of familiarization when i lived in canada i noticed that they expressed the message that guns were terrifying on a regular basis on canadian tv the popular show flashpoint was a police procedural about an sru team in toronto sru is the canadian version of swat whenever a civilian saw a person with a gun a gun in a car or a gun in a desk drawer they completely freaked out they immediately phoned the police and sometimes they hid in closets whispering in terror to the   operator they needed to be saved because by golly guns kill you guns are strictly controlled in canada and this was just a reinforcement of the message that the government was protecting citizens by keeping firearms away from them as well as the message that you must immediately phone the officials should one be seen subliminal messaging is way more subtle than predictive programming messages are played to individuals or the public without them being aware of it the message may be a visual flash in a series of other pictures that you dont consciously pick up on but your subconscious registers the image one example would be a movie where frame   in a sequence of   images moving at   frames per second flashes the name of a product a person or whatever other information the producers wanted you to take in even if you dont believe in your conscious mind that subliminal messaging can have any effect on youyour unconscious mind has no such view it accepts whats sent to it without question when companies advertise politicians stand on the stage or gangs roam down the street we see their colors the sign symbol or slogan that defines them its all marketing and branding and subliminal messaging can get that message into your brain without you knowingly visualizing it and it works a multi million dollar industry has been created from self help tapes and cds that are played while a person sleeps to improve some aspect of the persons life experiments with inserting a subliminal message about snacks right before a break in a movie increased snack sales during the break this technique is heavily used by companies with products to sell the uncomfortable thing is unless you instructed someone to put the messages in there or you put them there yourself there is no way you can know if you are being subjected to such suggestions heres exactly how fast that can happen plus some information on why this works so effectively creepy right so what happens if the messages we are receiving arent just about buying a soda and some popcorn what if they are rather more insidious in nature what if we are being manipulated every time we turn on a tv watch a movie or even turn on our computers some of us are aware of the dumbing down of our young people their total addiction to their smartphones tablets and laptops the hours and hours they watch tv kids are completely addicted to their screens if someone wanted to use screens as mind control methods then it makes perfect sense to get kids dependent upon those screens while theyre young they can be programmed from the very beginning to be good little consumers and to pay for it by being wage slaves nearly everyone has a smartphone these days which means we all carry a mind control device around in our purses or pockets taking it a step further what if some people are genetically more susceptible than others what if some of us are immune to this constant bombardment of images words and ideas that most people seem to buy into without question could this be the difference between the vast majority of the people and those of us are that are awake and aware are we just mutants is this why i can explain this stuff until i lose my voice and just get a blank stare from people who think i am the crazy one the vast majority of people in the united states arecompletely accepting of the official message most people like usthose who are aware the self sufficient minority watch less tv than the masses some of us watch no tv at all i watch a few shows on netflix or amazon prime but we dont have cable tv with its commercials and cough news we have other things to do things that will help us when there are soldiers on the streets for our own protectionthings that will help our kids survive when the store shelves are empty and the majority relies on government rations to live if they behave well enough to get one that is and behave they will because hunger is a massive motivator to do as youre told even if you have a tendency to be mind controlled its possible to snap out of it i wasnt always the tinfoil clad blogger you see before you today when i was in my early  s i truly did believe that the government agencies like the epa and the fda were looking out for our best interests that food or medicine wouldnt be sold if it was harmful and that schools truly were in the business of educating children most of us have to shake off our early training at the hands of the education system and the television and sort of like in the movie the matrix if you can get someone to swallow the red pill they become a lot less willing to believe whatever theyre fed subliminal messaging can change peoples views can change the way they think can change what they want to eat what car they want to buy maybe even how they vote all you need is the cash to get your message out there and buy a few split seconds of screen time it can sow the seeds that make acceptance of abnormal and dangerous situations easier it can teach people not to question and to be good little sheep sitting for hours in front of the television mindlessly watching the drivel produced by companies who call it entertainment is brainwashing people and turning them into idiots making the best current day example of predictive programming the movieidiocracy all you have to do is look around and youll see that its here daisy luther is a freelance writer and editor her website wherethis article first appeared

atdaisytheorganicprepperca read these three books again if you have to ray bradburys fahrenheit   aldous huxleys brave new world george orwells   if you dont want to take time to read these books at least watch the movie versions a good and entertaining movie is they live which exposes the use of subliminals roddy piper the hero of the movie said that they live was not just a movie but a documentary this is from a guy who was a professional wrestler i used to read tons of so called sci fi books and there was common theme in many of them where technology becomes an enemy through misuse human error or shear evil intent question everything believe nothing until you are convinced what you are seeing is real or not real examples would be   or the murders of jfk rfk and mlk look into all aspects of these events think about the possibilities of all aspects and come to some kind of conclusion then move on to other dicey subjects like sandy hook  san bernardino attack orlando pulse nightclub attack and so many others these are all psychological operations psy ops done by governments we are constantly being bombarded with these false flag attacks and they are backed up with the help of the corrupt propagandistic so called news media toss out the teevee approach any media with skepticism and find out as much as you can on things like false flags and mind control the advertising industry have no morals they use imagery of every kind usually sexual to sell their clients products there seems to be more and more satanicmasonic symbolism in the entertainment industry especially in muse sick videos and fashion magazines there is much death cult imagery child abuse sexist and ritualistic in modern videos and of course all that bling and materialist crap it is time to become aware of all the ways you are being subjected to the constant bombardment of these images from edward bernays nephew of sigmund freud and father of modern propaganda and public relations to goebbels to the cia with project monarch and others and now modern advertising people have been swayed without even knowing it it is a cumulative effect that is why so many muse sick videos have the same boring pyramids   one eyed horus themes and even the colours used over and over and over again and again look at all the personalities that are seen making the horned sign which is actually a representation of the egyptian sand viper that hides in the sand its unique horns sticking out of the sand look at all the same stupid one eyed pics representing the egyptian god horus look at all the pharonic kabbalistic satanic masonic and illuminati themes those in these industries are into all these various forms of occultism they are spreading their own religious messages and trying to convince our children and youth to get involved in this system of belief as well many rituals are being performed at muse sick video awards sports of all kinds including the olympics and especially the recent opening of the swiss tunnel they are becoming more and more audacious and open about these themes a quick study of this stuff will help release you from their influence take the damn blue pill you mean red pill right yeah sorry the one that doesnt take you further down the rabbit hole thanks   jfk rfk and mll  massive hoaxesfrauds do some proper research many of them use the same symbols that is true but they are not using the entertainment biz to corrupt children as for the assassinations where is your proof to them all being hoaxes youre taking this thing way too far the conspiracy around these events is that in each case it was a lone gunman these men were murdered because they were changing the system which was becoming totally corrupt the swearing in of criminal lyndon johnson was the beginning of the worst and now look how far things have sank deplorable they are not using the entertainment biz to corrupt children the khazarian mafia use esoteric math to structure their evil agenda a small example is that   rev       explicitly mentioned in that verse    now treat this as a year bc and convert to the hebrew calendar        founding year of the illuminati i spent   years teaching add adhd kids in a targeted riding program way harder than abcs math i designed it because even back in the  s psychiatrists were drugging their kids before the fake disorder was defined by the doctor who admitted on his death bed that it was not real only a ruse to sell drugs way to go by using your own inner knowledge and excellent powers of observation hugs the rabbit hole brings exactly johnny canuk as a freshman in high school our english class watched videos it was an experiment the kids were guinea pigs only what they didnt know is that i was able to see the subliminal messages and repeat them verbatim some of the messages were lines of numbers some were orders some were ideas none of the other kids could see or retain or consciously know that there were hidden messages it turns out that those who can are very rare a group of     men in black suits showed up at the high school a few weeks later i performed for them showed them i could easily see the subliminal messages retain and repeat then started the special tests then started the information sharing showing me reports written by persons in the intelligence community wanting me

4,over the weekend with its cable rivals devoting generous airtime to demonstrations convulsing tehran and online viewers transfixed by amateur video of a young woman apparently felled by a snipers bullet msnbc stuck to its usual diet of taped documentaries including one titled sex slaves in america a rerun of the prison documentary lockup aired saturday night meanwhile anchor shepard smith was giving viewers of fox news channel a special two hour wrap up of iranian developments cnn likewise devoted substantial blocks of time to covering the crisis live msnbc has a precedent for giving short shrift to major stories that have erupted on weekends critics chafed when the network bailed on wall to wall coverage of the mumbai terrorist standoff in november which began on a wednesday and did not end until saturday but executives also have proved they are willing to drop their usual plans in certain situations on the weekend of april   when an american skipper was rescued from somali pirates msnbc broke into its regular programming with live coverage for its part the network defended its handling of the iran crisis saying it was ready to spring into action if the situation there escalated further we were monitoring the situation closely and decided that we would cover the situation with hourly updates msnbc spokesman jeremy gaines wrote in an e mail response to questions we had an anchor and crew standing by he also dismissed the suggestion that the coverage plans were dictated by financial considerations although he did not provide specifics as for the taped shows these programs generate higher viewership for us on weekends than other types of programming gaines added but given the intensity of the reaction elsewhere msnbcs decision over the weekend struck many as puzzling i was surprised they did not break into their air for iran coverage said marvin kalb a former cbs newsman and a senior fellow at the joan shorenstein center at harvard university its one of the great stories of our time and something the american people need to know about from its founding   years ago taped fare has been a key part of msnbcs makeup but since the network began experimenting with greater use of documentaries in   about   months ago the taped shows started appearing from noon to   pm on weekends as well the network has struggled to blend that programming with what it does at other hours that includes breaking news coverage as well as the popular prime time shows hosted by keith olbermann and rachel maddow which have helped drive overall ratings gains in recent months the juxtaposition sometimes has resulted in a hazy identity phil griffin who last summer was tapped to be president of msnbc in the past has indicated a desire at least to tweak the taped format i want our prime time personalities to drive more of our documentaries griffin told reporters in january typically the tape strategy poses few problems as news tends to slow on the weekends anyway but there has been nothing typical about the violence that has seized iran a country in flux since the disputed presidential election june   saturday saw the protests reach a climax with gory amateur video that purported to show the death of   year old neda agha soltan ricocheting around the web and into the mainstream media within hours optional add end although the msnbc documentaries tend to do better than news coverage during non crisis times they are by no means huge ratings grabbers on saturday fox news drew an average of    million total viewers for its iran heavy coverage beating the combined totals of cnn    and msnbc    smiths   pm hour averaged    million making it the weekends most watched cable news program according to nielsen media research gaines pointed out however that msnbc beat cnn among viewers aged   to   the most favored demographic in the news business

1,post election the media and donald trump voters everywhere have been rewriting recent history they are making the claim that trump wasnt elected because of racism he was elected because of the economy the problem with that argument though is that its simply not true trump voters are racist and theres proof   the american national elections study anes began the study in january initially they asked how likely is it that many whites are unable to find a job because employers are hiring minorities instead now of course anyone who spends more than five minutes listening to those in minority communities know the answer to that its very unlikely that whites arent getting jobs because minorities are but thats not what trump voters think the vast majority said that its extremely likely that minorities are taking jobs from white people graph courtesy of anes and salon    then they asked the same trump voters about a non racial issue trade despite the fact that trade was one of trumps signature issues their opinions on trade were mixed   post election this is what the study found   the question about white jobs is powerfully linked to support for trump over clinton eighty four percent of whites who believe it is extremely likely that whites cant find a job because employers are hiring people of color instead support trump compared with   percent of those who think it is not at all likely among white democrats   percent who believe people of color are taking jobs support trump over clinton compared with less than   percent of those who believe it is not at all likely eighty one percent of white women who think it is extremely likely people of color are taking jobs supported trump compared with   percent who dont think that   more than that   percent of white trump supporters say black people are violent   percent think that of muslims   unfortunately democrats might not be able to just ride out this wave of racism hoping that eventually the aging bigots will die off it turns out their children are just as bad sean mcelwee the man who was responsible for publishing the study suggested this   democrats must create a narrative that weaves economic racial and gender justice together a multiracial coalition is the path to sustained political power and reductions in economic racial and gender inequality as ive shown with political scientist jason mcdaniel racism often diminishes support for progressive policies the solution is not to abandon either the white working class or the diverse and rising american electorate that still stands poised to transform the nation   great idea if we had a media that reported facts instead of letting bigots claims go unchallenged

3,syrians have no food natomsm have no shame madaya starvation photos faked for propagandaby brandon turbeville the latest attempt at portraying assad as the new hitler without a shred of real evidence claims that he is starving the residents of madaya for some undefined purpose that would allegedly benefit his grip on power actually according to the western media no motives are necessary for the west and its populations totally lacking in discernment assad is starving the people of madaya and that is enough but the truth is that assad is not starving the people of madaya the people of madaya are suffering because their village is overrun with the savages supported by nato the gcc and israel unfortunatelythe western media that insists upon calling them rebels and activists instead of what they are regardless the recent photos circulating throughout the western media have been entirely misrepresented in order to condemn assad the syrian military for instance the photo currently being circulated by the western media and a number of pro war ngos purporting to show a little syrian girl being starved by assad is actually a photo of a lebanese girl marianna marzeh mariannas picture was being used side by side with that of a starving girl so emaciated that she appears at the very brink of death but marianna is alive and well living in lebanon with a full stomach her family has stepped forward to clear the record that she is not a victim of assad and even marianna herself can be seen in a video saying someone stole her picture off the internet the picture thieves were of course the death squad fanatics currently terrorizing the people of syria but attempting to use sympathy for a small child of which they have none to demonize their enemy the saudi arabian satellite tv network al arabiya has been the number one progenitor of the fake connection between mariannas photo and the starving girl mariannas photo has now been used for the second time for propaganda purposes by the jihadists another photo used and claimed to be from madaya was of a young boy being interviewed and claiming to be suffering from starvation and want while the suffering was real the picture was not from madaya but from the yarmouk camp in syria a palestinian refugee camp located in damascus the photo was also from july   yet it did not stop the bbcs jim muir from posting the image as an example of assads cruelty to civilians one image being circulated throughout the western media of an emaciated boy was paraded about by many mainstream sources including the associated press in reality however the picture was one that was taken in   the original having been touched up to enhance the boys emaciated features the intl spectator intlspectator january     navstva navsteva january     another popular image being circulated by the likes of vice news and donatella rivera amnesty internationals senior crisis advisor is neither current nor from madaya the photo shows a very emaciated young boy crouching shirtless on the floor ribs jutting out and staring at the camera it was first posted in   rt continues in a separate report entitled first aid convoys enter besieged syrian town of madaya various media outlets including the telegraph the independent bbc cnn and fox news said syrians were eating domestic animals and had been left without any help some media didnt bother to re check the authenticity of images allegedly showing dying madaya residents no one has as yet been able to confirm that the images are actually authentic rt decided to investigate the photos one haunting image posted on arab speaking social media shows a starving man supposedly lying somewhere in the streets of madaya a town with a population of about    people the victims of starvation caused by bashar assad hezbollah and iranian militias on madaya and al zabadani says the caption under the image however the story behind the starving man turned out to be fabricated in fact he starved to death in the city of ghouta a year ago according to the syrian american medical society the picture was taken on january     mohammad yoususf an najjar disabled from damascus died on   january due to extreme cold and lack of food during the government forces siege of eastern ghouta the syrian network of human rights said      another horrendous picture of a starving man in madaya has turned out to be a drug addict or refugee according to other sources taken in europe in   his eyes were even photoshopped to hide the fact they are blue the image originally appeared on al jazeera it was subsequently deleted but not before it had been retweeted many times the hardships facing madaya citizens are very real but the governing force of madaya is not the syrian government but the terrorists backed by the west and the gcc the town has long been overrun by terrorist al qaeda forces most notably ahrar al sham it should be noted that ahrar al sham is also sieging and starving two other villages in syria fua and kefraya as one resident of madaya an   year old man told the cameras the rebels are trading in peoples blood they are the ones taking all the rice then selling it for     notes    cigarettes for    lira a chocolate bar for    lira and they butchered our children burned our trees they caused all this when aid arrived they stole it and are selling it at high prices indeed the residents of madaya cannot be any clearer as to who is destroying their lives you can also see a number of additional eyewitness testimonies in this video by mimi al laham syrian girl posted on her syriangirlpartisan youtube channel as can be seen from the video even the bbc aired a partial clip of residents of madaya screaming at the so called rebels for food and haranguing them for stealing the aid that belongs to civilians it is also interesting to note that qatari based al jazeera is promoting statistics that simply do not match up with the facts according to aj up to    people live in madaya and most of them are starving all because the syrian government has some illogical plan to starve innocent people according to other statistics such as the census conducted by the syrian central bureau of statistics and reports by rt however madaya has only    residents clearly there is a massive discrepancy in the numbers with qatar having acted as a sponsor and bankroller of terrorists in syria one would question the legitimacy of the claims made by the organization the very fact that such varying numbers can be assigned to one population is evidence enough that there is an agenda afoot regardless of whether the images being used by the ngo and journalistic communities are from syria   or some other location or time the fact is that these communities are using photos that are undoubtedly altered misrepresented and paraded as if they are something they are not in other words the photos are a part of willful deception by these same organizations starving children the images now being paraded throughout the western media in order to drum up hatred for bashar al assad are images that selectively pull upon the strings of the selective western conscience it is a curious thing that millions dead at the hands of the us military are merely collateral damage and are deemed worthy of death with the western public even deriving some strange sense of righteousness and masculinity at the sight of bodies while at the same time the photo of one hungry child is enough to sway their opinion of war and peace in syria tens of thousands of dead children are par for the course in america several dead children are justification for the destruction of the constitution and basic rights it is a curious thing indeed that the western media always reports the stories that rattles the collective conscience and that the collective conscience of the nation always responds to the western medias stories as if they were tailor made for the psyche of the general public clearly the people of the west should question a conscience that must be told what it feels guilty about they should also begin to wonder where their own inner voice might be and where they were when it was silenced brandon turbeville article archive here is the author of six books codex alimentarius the end of health freedom   real conspiracies five

largely emphasizing the starvation and unimaginable overall suffering with little baggage the focus of these articles is on the un reporting on average   or   times in each article the seemingly

more global governance problem reaction solution and crimes against humanity the end justifies the means and cremation of care ceremonies bohemian grove how can we stop it stop it by voting for rand paul paul is toast the best we can do is vote for sanders who is capable of beating hawks trump cruz and rubio the top republican contenders he can also beat hawk clinton since his poll numbers have risen from   with minimal media attention to beating her in the first two primary states voting for rand paul is a wasted vote he also proposed an amendment to incr sanders is not perfect but he is the least likely to get us involved in war wars of all candidates i believe youre right rhonda our govt is almost to the point of no return in terms of deep capture but if enough people woke up and stopped watching the stupid kabuki theater on their boob tubes a rand paul nomination would send a powerful message that we wont go along anymore with business as usual i attended a large ron paul rally inside the denver convention center when he was running for potus ive never felt that kind of energy in my entire life thousands of fully awake people including the young loose change filmmakers handing out leaflets outside and people thanking them it felt great all of the other candidates represent more of the same and serve the same masters to succeed a freedom revolution would have to be a multi level assault on every level of infiltration never fear cremation of scare reminds me of the striped pyjamas of world war two the fakery just keeps flowing through all the world is a stage all the whirled hold on to your frocks and i note that the staged is now bursting at the seams to the tune of the unholy choir all irans now put in the fire expecting some over the top performances any moment the lame stream media to pronounce the final denouement murdoch is a big shareholder in genie energyand israel gave genie thats why we are in syria trying to overthrow assad its so obvious even trump says get the oil but that oil belongs to the syrian people russia got there first so now what war with russia israel better watch their step because pootie dont play the deposit in the golan is one of the largest in the world if not the pure greedand we are getting caught in the middle you might consider the notion that the narrative that tptb intended to overthrow assad was an elaborate ruse to provide cover for the creation of isis and other objectives ive found extensive documentation showing the syrian and russian elites are tightly connected to the the west where most of their wealth is invested and they have fully accepted the nwo paradigm of technocracy un agenda   imfbisworld bank overisght neoliberalization of their economies including massive foreign investment and privatization of public assets going back to the  s as imf directed programs in the early to mid  s this process was greatly accelerated when for instance assads billionaire cousin rami makhlouf who controls   percent of syrias economy began funneling money in the un agenda   sustainability model and this cousin is also the major shareholder of a transnational oil company operating extensively for years in syria under the control of goldman sachs bank of america barclays etc as well he has most of his wealth in dubai and offshore shell companies instead of investing in his own people the russian plutocracy follow the money trail to the wests nwo paradigm is much more glaring and has been extensively documented the alt media accepted the line that syria was one of the nations targeted for overthrow because of elite nwo insider wesley clarks public admission that syria was on the list but it was clark who recently suggested in a public interview americans who oppose the war on terror agenda thought criminals should be placed in internment camps clark always drank the kool aid so why did he leak the list and why did he claim it was a subordinate who informed him what the grand plan was very fishy and the us and israel had been quietly supplying iran with advanced military weaponry for years and iran was known to be passing these weapons on to syria even though us officials were publicly stating both nations were run by dangerous rogue dictators and now we recently heard that the pentagon was giving assad intel on the location of isis these issues have not been deconstructed in the alt media never accept the line there be crhooks at all ends just to add to your expose so fine blue  and to wit saddam gaddafi deaths faked a la bowie   lying in a blackstar state the matrix just love it when the sheople ruminate whilst the cabal false flag away towards their nwo date at this point nothing surprises me the kafka esque moments have become a steady stream of nwo phlegm and mental razors thank you padraigin eagle for sharing your excellent wit and poetic prowess thank goodness for the rare and fleeting signs some highly intelligent life has survived the suffocating confines of the matrix the pleasure be mine not to put too fine a point to it touch blue my being colour two gently touched as i am by your rapier through your words as designed stir the finer minds time for the comatose to raise the blinds yet when they finally see will they be willing to fly with the free or would they prefer to van winkle be one important piece of the puzzle early on in the syria conflict it would have been a simple matter of routing out the western sponsored terrorists with syria russia and iran working together to methodically push them out they had the resources no question about it so why did they sit on their hands and do half measures it seems it was to buy time for the conflict to metastasize into operation cyclone    the creation of an al qaeda type group but bigger and composed of more foreign nationals to unleash on the world  isis unfortunately alt writers not knowing or admitting russia was already nwo created a blind spot if i saw it coming at least a few others had to have figured it out too puzzle no more blu  shows them up for sure they all be in the same big bed east vs west designed to the psyop needle thread until the sheoples eyes be well and truly bled obama drama and putin a shooting the same puppet hands since way back in time be a looting old new world disorder now upon every border believe nothing absolutely nothing the pathological liars in gvt and the mainstream media tell you it is all a lie to be sure ah if theyre starving nato has only itself to blame i was laughing when i heard     in madaya were starvingthat figure made no sense at all and for all of them to be starving yeah rightwe know this trickery has been used at every rebel terror pig controlled town in syriait is amazing to know that despite the big elephant in the room idiots still only point finger at assad and try to equate the gov to terrorists while completely ignoring the terror caused by these groups

3,survival basics preparing for a grid down power outagegaye levy contributor some of the basic items you need to have on hand to get through a power outage are quite simple and arethings you probably have on hand this is a very short list relatively speaking and unless you have been living in a cocoon in siberia chances are that these items have already been set aside so that they will be readily available when the lights blink off and for a three or four hour outage you will be just fine with these items but what if the power is lost for a longer period of time for whatever reason how will you cook your food how will you keep warm how will you insure your safety in dark these are just a few of the issues you will face if there is an extended power outage add infants the elderly or the infirm to the mix and you have a big problem on your hands today i want to get back to survival basics and offer some suggestions and ideas for preparing your household for an extended power outage my goal is to get those wheels cranking in your brain that is and to provide you with a starter checklist of suggestions that can be implemented in stages as your needs and budget allow   store foods that require very little of no warming or cooking these foods should b items that your family normally eats suggestions canned meats cold cereals peanut butter crackers canned fruits and veggies if you are a coffee drinker include some instant coffee as well the list is endless but let me caution you if you gag at the thought of cold ravioli out of a can now you will also gag if you have to eat it in an emergency power out situation dont be silly store foods that are meant to be eaten cold or at room temperature and dont forget the manual can opener and some disposable plates and utensils   acquire one or more alternate cooking sources such a fire pit charcoal barbeque or camp stove we are lucky that we have a propane cook top in our kitchen that can easily be lit with a match in addition we havevolcano iicollapsible stove and ecozoom rocket stovethat burns biomass patina cast iron fire pitthat is set up for cooking a couple of butane stoves and a gas grill   have at least one lantern that will cast a wide beam that is large enough to fill a room with brightness when the sun goes down we have both a coleman propane lanternand a coleman battery driven lanterncolemans are a timeless choice because they last forever and replacement parts even for older models are readily available   store fuel for your chosen energy device this could be wood for the fire pit propane cylinders for the gas grill or   pounds of charcoal it could also be large bucket of pinecones or twigs to use as biomass in your rocket stove the point is to store fuel you are going to need it one more point educate yourself on the proper storage of fuel all of the food in the world will not help you one bit if you blow yourself to bits   blankets are good but a nice toasty sleeping bag or down comforter is better and a heavy jacket plus socks are good too it is easy to strip down when the temperatures soar not that that is the optimal way to keep cool but when you are cold you need to bundle up and stay warm   invest in a generator we recently invested in a   kw whole house generator that will automatically power our home during the frequent outages on our island think it wont happen to you a few years back the city of seattle was dark for almost a week it happens a portable generator can be purchased for as little as   or   and the sky is the limit after that just keep in mind that the installation by a qualified electrician is probably going to cost as much as the generator itself also make sure you test the installation i can not stress this too much in my own recent experience i was caught with no refrigerator power during a short term outage because i stupidly trusted the electrician to get things right wrong the wiring from the refrigerator to the master panel was not connected so whatever you do test and test again every few months or so   if you have the proper sun exposure the budget and the space consider solar power as a backup to your local power grid many local utilities states and yes even the federal government offer financial incentives and policies that promote renewable energy it is worth checking in to   fill empty milk or juice jugs with water then store them in your freezer so that all of the spare nooks and crannies are filled this will serve a variety of purposes the freezer will operate more efficiently because it is full plus if there is an outage the frozen jugs of ice will hold the contents cool for a longer period of time you can even move some of the jugs of ice to your refrigerator to keep things cold for a short term following an unexpected outage note the water stored in this manner when thawed can be used for cleaning or flushing but not for drinking unless it is purified or filtered okay so we have covered basic power needs but what are some of the other essentials that you will want to have on hand during a power outage how about the following i hope these ideas will start you on the road to thinking about a power outage and how you can prepare to keep yourself warm light and well during a power outage and once you are prepared i suggest you pop up a big pot of popcorn and get yourself a copy of the movie the trigger effect i saw this film when it first came out and still find it chilling here a synopsis do yourself a favor and buy some canned goods a flashlight and a radio before you watch this filmunfairly dismissed by the critics and missed by the public this pre y k suspense film is a chilling sobering experience that will turn any practical person into a paranoid apocalyptic loon

3,stock markets all over the world crash as we begin  by michael snyder in the us it looked like we were on course for a truly historic day as well the dow jones industrial average was down   points at one stage but some very mysterious late day buying activity helped trim the loss to just   points at the close of the market the sudden market turmoil caught many by surprise but it shouldnt have the truth is that a whole host of leading indicators have been telling usthat this is exactly what should be happening the global financial crisis that began in   is now accelerating and my regular readers already know precisely what is coming next the financial turmoil of the last   hours is making headlines all over the globe it began last night in china very bad manufacturing data and another troubling devaluation of the yuan sent chinese stocks tumbling to a degree that we have not seen since last august in fact the carnage would have probably been far far worse if not for a new circuit breaker that china recently implemented once the csi   was down   percent trading was completely shut down for the rest of the day the following comes fromusa today under a new market circuit breaker rule in china established last year which is designed to slow down markets and halt panic in the event of moves of   or more the csi   a large company stock index in mainland china was halted for   minutes in mid afternoon trading after diving more than   but when shares headed lower once again just minutes after the initial trading halt and losses for the day swelled to more than   the new circuit breaker rules kicked in prompting a shutdown of mainland chinas stock market for the day according to bloomberg after the first   minute halt panic set in as chinese traders rushed to get out of their trades before the   percent circuit breaker kicked in this resulted inan absolutely chaotic seven minutes as investors made a mad dash for the exits the sell orders piled up fast on monday at shenwan hongyuan group chinas fifth biggest brokerage by market value chinas csi   index had just tumbled   percent triggering a   minute trading halt and stock investors were scrambling to exit before getting locked in by a full day suspension set to take effect at   percent when the first halt was lifted the market reaction was swift it took just seven minutes for losses to reach the limit as volumes surged to their highs of the day investors rushed to the door during the level one stage of the circuit breaker as they fretted the market would go down further said william wong the head of sales trading at shenwan hongyuan in hong kong the financial carnage continued once the european markets opened markets were red all across the continent and things were particularly bad in germany the dax was down   points and it is rapidly approaching the psychologically important    barrier overall it was the worst start to a year that the european markets have ever experienced when us markets opened unexpectedly bad us manufacturing data seemed to add fuel to the fire monday morning we learned that our manufacturing sector is contracting at a pacethat we havent seen since the last recession americas manufacturing sector shrank for the second straight month in december the industrys key index ism hit    in december the lowest mark since june   anything below   is a contraction and a month ago it hit    the index has fallen for six straight months the trend is certainly heading in a direction that would ring alarm bells says sam bullard senior economist at wells fargo this is yet another sign that tells us that the us economy has already entered the next recession and what happens to the markets during a recession they go down in addition to the bad datathat we got from the us and china there was another number that was also extremely troubling south korean exports have traditionallybeen considered a key leading indicator for the entire global economy and on monday we learned that they were downa whopping    percentin december from a year earlier one of the more reliable indicators of the global economy continues to confirm fears of a worldwide slowdown south korean exports also referred to as the worlds economic canary in the coal mine fell    in december from a year earlier this was a deterioration from the    decline in november and it was much worse than the    decline expected by economists the nothing is happening crowd may not be willing to admit it yet but the truth is that a major global economic slowdown is already happening and what happened to global markets today is perfectly consistent with the longer term patterns that have been emerging over the past six months or so in the weeks and months to come things are going to get even worse there will always be days when the markets are up but dont let those days fool you into thinking that the crisis is over in the western world we are so accustomed to   hour news cycles and many of us seem to be incapable of focusing on trends that develop over longer periods of time if i was going to put together a scenario for a global financial crisis for a textbook what we have seen over the past six months or so would be perfect things are playing out exactly how they should be and that means big trouble for the rest of   but that doesnt mean that we have to live in fear in fact i just wrote an entire article entitled   a year for living with no fear it is when times are at their worst that our character is put to the test some will respond to what happens in   with courage and strength and others will respond with fear and panic as things start falling apart all around us this year how will you respond michael snyder is a writer speaker and activist who writes and edits

1,the democrats have become synonymous with the word scandal in this election we have yet another scandal and reason to distrust obama and hillary clintonjust for you president obamas justice department has been caught red handed stealing money which should be going to victims of crimes and putting it into the hands of left wing advocacy groups as per breitbart  this new scandal comes after we saw hillary clinton cleared of charges for acid washing her emails this clearance came from the justice department as run by a person who had private meetings with bill clinton prior to the decision this also happened after hillary clinton said that if she was elected she would reappoint the current attorney generalthat same personloretta lynch the key facts of this news scandal are as follows the justice department has millions of dollars of taxpayer money that is usually reserved for the victims of serious crimes however obama has been funneling money in the ballpark of   million away from victims of serious crimes and towards organizations that are helping him this money is supposed to be going to victims of federal crimes like gang violence wall street corruption or other white collar crimes its normally used for restitution of the money the victims lost as a result of criminal actions is it surprising obama thinks this money should be lining his pockets instead obama and his cronies find ways to make these left wing advocacy groups victims of crimes these are organizations are signing people up to vote going to rallies knocking on doors and helping elect hillary clintonnot advocacy groups that need restitution of money lost to criminals obamas justice department has failed us once again instead of abusing taxpayer money this justice department should be prosecuting hillary clinton for lying to congress destroying evidence after receiving a congressional subpoena and obstructing justice this is alone is enough to impeach the president but we all know there simply isnt enough time left in his presidency to do so but maybe we could get the paperwork rolling just to scare him a little bit if elected it is clear hillary clinton will continue these corrupt practices especially with loretta lynch as her attorney general the justice department especially will remain a pay to getaway operation

4,us secretary of state hillary clinton has conveyed her regret to azerbaijan president ilham aliyev over leaked us diplomatic cables that compared him to a mafia boss from the godfather films in her telephone call on wednesday clinton reiterated to president aliyev that the us relationship with azerbaijan remains strong clinton spokesman philip crowley told reporters and she took the opportunity to convey her regret for the wikileaks disclosures he added when asked what aliyevs response was to her expression of regret for the cables leaked by the whistle blower website wikileaks crowley replied he simply indicated that he did not think that alleged cables would affect our long term relationship crowley said azerbaijan remains a key partner of the united states something the secretary also stressed when she visited baku last july azerbaijan works with the united states as a member of the international security assistance force isaf coalition in afghanistan and also cooperates on counter terrorism he said one of the leaked memos suggested that aliyev who succeeded his father heydar aliyev as president of ex soviet azerbaijan in   had become increasingly authoritarian at home while conducting a more pragmatic foreign policy this divergence of approaches has led some observers to compare the aliyevs with the fictional corleones of godfather fame said the memo dated september   and published by wikileaks the memo alleged the azerbaijani president had created an elaborate patronage network and strong armed opponents and thus the aliyev administration has developed an organized crime image in some quarters leading some analysts to see ilham aliyev at times in a mafia like role aliyevs office has described the release of the cables by wikileaks as an open provocation it also denied that the he had made statements to a us diplomat questioning the authority of the russian president dmitry medvedev the thoughts and opinions attributed by the website to the president of the azerbaijani republic ilham aliyev absolutely do not reflect reality and are absolutely unfounded the presidents press office said in a written statement
1,it has been suggested that democrat presidential nominee hillary clinton is perfectly ok with people dying if it furthers a particular agenda or serves to protect her own vested interests   by way of example we could easily point to the   benghazi terrorist attack in which four americans under the auspices of clintons state department were killed or her staunch support for abortion  which has abruptly ended the lives of millions of innocent babies before they were even born   now it has been alleged that clinton may bear responsibility for the deaths of children who had already been born   of them to be exact who perished tragically in the massive inferno that enveloped the branch davidian compound in waco texas in   according to david t hardy an attorney and waco expert writing for the american thinker    those who remember what happened in waco will recall that there had been a long and intense standoff between dozens of members of a cult and federal authorities over alleged trafficking and possession of illegal firearms   that standoff ultimately degenerated into an all out assault on the compound with armored vehicles heavy weapons and copious amounts of tear gas eventually starting a massive fire that burned the compound to the ground killing   members of the group including   children   that tragedy has been largely blamed on then attorney general janet reno but there is some evidence to suggest that the order to assault the compound came from the clinton white house perhaps even from hillary herself   one piece of evidence that may point to that conclusion is the transcript of the fbis interview with lisa foster following the death of her husband vince which was ruled a suicide

3,the most dangerous greeting your child may ever receivechristina england as we are aware the governments and pharmaceutical companies are always searching for new ways to push vaccinations onto unsuspecting parents the earlier they can target a childs parents the better they like it one of the vaccination initiatives being used by twenty seven states across the us is to send every new parent a congratulations on the birth of your baby card according to reports governors from twenty seven states across the us have teamed up with hallmark greeting cards to send every new parent a card following the birth of their baby the card includes a personal message from the governor of their state a detachable growth chart and an up to date immunization schedule this vaccination initiative attempts to make parents fully aware which vaccinations their newborn baby should receive the healthy home economist reporting on the story stated having the cards actually come from state governors themselves is the new twist which gives the programs friendly pressure to vaccinate a more personal and authoritative touch   with love from your state government when it began the immunization rates for children up to age   in missouri and kansas were roughly   percent and   percent respectively immunization rates for the youngest citizens in those states now hover around   percent according to the programs website   beth kaplan a spokesperson with the state of wisconsins division of public health whose state vaccination compliance rates have reached as high as   percent since the implementation of this program believes that this initiative is just one way to create awareness about the importance of vaccinations for children she says the program is one of many things we do to encourage the vaccination of children your tax dollars at work for big pharma i am sure that one question on many peoples lips is who exactly is paying for these cards sadly you are according to reports the taxpayers are footing the bill for the implementation of hallmarks for americas babiesproject and it does not come cheap although hallmark greeting cards is supplying the cards and paying for the printing costs an initiative which they proudly boast on their website the state of florida alone has budgeted    for the distribution of these cards which has been hailed as an excellent program   the cards are very attractive in pastel colors with added bunnies and flowers for effect i am sure that most new parents would be very moved by this gesture the mid america immunization coalition has been so impressed by hallmarks wonderful work that in   they awarded hallmark the sending the very best message award in presenting the award coalition director deb bumgardner said hallmark is definitely one of the behind the scenes unsung heroes in the fight to raise immunization rates in the united states   heroes is not a term i would use behind the scenes are definitely the real key words and thats where we are going to take a look in order to tell you the whole story of these unsung heroes in   hallmark cards joined forces with unicef to form a partnership today hallmark cards is the exclusive creator manufacturer and distributor for all unicef greeting cards and gifts sold in the united states giving unicef more than   million in royalty payments from the sale of their cards and gifts the us fund for unicef receives   percent of every net wholesale shipment of unicef hallmark products according to hallmark cards unicef works in more than   countries to keep children alive and safe the organization focuses on providing children with clean water food medicine vaccines and education   remember unicef is also responsible for testing vaccines on children in the developing world this year i found them linked to forty children paralyzed in a small village in africa after they received the test vaccine menafrivac   unicef also was involved in the testing of the pentavalent vaccine quinvaxem which caused the deaths of   children across the developing world   in   hallmark in partnership with unicef won the fastest growing family business award sponsored by barclays at the family business awards   according to the family business awards website hallmark made a record year turnover amounting to a massive   million an increase of   since   hallmark also commissioned nottinghams together agency to design the unicef uk new range catalog which echoes leo burnetts unicef international theme and promoted the charitys new line of products in     look who else is holding hands with hallmark as well as their links to unicef hallmark cards has interesting links to other organizations which need to be exposed the chairman of hallmark cards is donald j hall and the current president and ceo of hallmark cards is david e hall both men are trustees to a company called mriglobal   page   mriglobal offers world class expertise and experience in bioanalytical model development testing and validationa complete array of services for the development and licensing of new vaccines they also supply government and industrial clients with high purity reference grade chemicals their website states mriglobals work in the development and testing of human and veterinary vaccine candidates encompasses safety toxicity potency efficacy and vaccine formulation stability   this indicates that this company is in the business of testing vaccines on both humans and animals interestingly mriglobal also has been linked to path and the fda one of mriglobals recent projects was in partnership with path   the project involved providing support to biotechnology companies that are developing influenza vaccines that can be accessible and affordable for low resource countries despite mriglobals noteworthy claim that their work encompasses safety toxicity potency efficacy and vaccine formulation stability children who have received vaccines from their partner organizations like path and unicef are still suffering many adverse reactions from these vaccinations path an organization which claims to help communities worldwide break longstanding cycles of poor health was involved recently with the testing of tens of thousands of tribal girls in india leaving them without appropriate follow up care as well as the vaccination trials in chad africa in which many children were paralyzed following vaccination   selling out to survive mriglobal is also involved in licensing medication and vaccinations for the fda and the cdc claiming to maintain all necessary licenses and certifications to conduct safe defensible studies on a host of diverse materials from pharmaceuticals to chemical agents mriglobal operates laboratories for the us department of energy and the us department of defense the company has been granted numerous licenses by the us government as well as internationally   this leaves me asking two questions the only answer i can come up with is money and lots of it the leaders of hallmark one of the largest privately owned companies in the us may have found a unique way to survive in a troubling economic times using their skills and knowledge to tap into the lucrative vaccine business as their greeting card endeavors have suffered stagnant sales and declining profits for years   conclusion what appeared at first glance to be an act of charity on behalf of hallmark cards now appears to be something far more sinister hallmark cards is doing more than making a tax deductible donation to the government in addition to recommending that parents keep up to date with their childrens vaccine schedules because the corporate leaders will profit from increased vaccination rates they are also heavily linked to the testing of vaccines on innocent animals and humans once highly regarded as an organization of love and caring hallmark cards now has tarnished its trademark crown with what can only be described as deep connections to several of the largest pharmaceutical organizations known to man so are hallmarks intentions as charitable as they would like us to believe it is clear that hallmark cards is affiliated with mriglobal the us government and canadian government unicef path fda and the cdc the common denominator linking all of these groups together is vaccination far from being the kindly souls they first appear to be and making sure that children stay strong and healthy i believe that the leaders of hallmark greeting cards are laughing all the way to the bank are you going to let them trick you into vaccinating your child without doing any research just because they sent you a card references christina was born and educated in london uk she left school to work in a childrens

3,the information war on a whole new level spaceulson gunnar in nations like russia china or iran ruling governments and local industry have begun creating their own internets their own alternatives to us controlled social media platforms and search engines and in some cases even their own hardware to run it all on they have also taken a cue from the us and decided to put in kill switches and censorship measures to prevent information from abroad being piped into their nation and disseminated among their populations or more accurate than saying to prevent information from abroad one could say propaganda from abroad for instance the us state departments voice of america network openly attempts to insert narratives favorable to us interests in targeted countries so important does the us state department see this mission it has even attempted to construct independent communication networks by building their own towers and relay stations the us state department has also spent millions of dollars on developing an internet in a suitcase or a means to create an internet among activists even when the government of a nation targeted by the us for regime change shuts down the real internet far from science fiction the new york times would even cover it in their article us underwrites internet detour around censors but the problem the us state department and the special interests that underwrite it is that such solutions are easily overcome by other governments and even non state actors operating in the defense of their nation against us backed sedition in order to crowdsource such a project and have it spread prolifically across the planet it must be made to appear altruistic unattached to the political subversion it is actually created for and put into the hands of unwitting well intentioned hackers for the purpose of building it refining it and perpetually updating it to adapt and overcome whatever challenges it faces enter the outernet at first glance the outernet looks like an amazing social project by genuine people interested in empowering people with the vast amounts of free information available on the internet it is a satellite based broadcast meaning it can reach anyone on earth with a receiver and while it talks about a library in your pocket and how having that information could change society it also talks about the inability for sovereign governments to censor it but who would want to censor a library at second glance one will notice syed karim the founder of outernet karim was previously director of innovation at the media development investment fund mdif which surprise funds the outernet and in turn mdif is run by former employees of open society with open society funding mdif in other words at second glance we see open society behind the outernet through a series of carefully concealed fronts and an incestuous tangled web of conflicts of interest the initial nobility of the concept only further spirals into the abyss of government  and corporate sponsored mass public persuasion and manipulation when one reads the archives of what has actually been broadcast already using outernet some of my favorites include war surgery perfect for americas terrorist mercenary army now operating in yemen syria iraq lebanon and libya there is also fema whos ebola site and the albert einstein institution advancing freedom through nonviolent action the albert einstein institution it should be remembered played a central role in building up the us state departments various networks behind so called color revolutions that have since hit ukraine the middle east and even as far as southeast and east asia content is broadcast based on votes but as everyone should know voting itself is subject to mass manipulation either of the voters own perception or of the very mechanics of the vote itself it is also very clear that content that is either well sponsored or is put out by well organized groups gets placed toward the top of the list including links to the jehovah witnesses thus the great equalizer karim claimed outernet is is in fact yet another channel of western government and corporate propaganda giving those who already monopolize vast territory amid the information war yet another weapon to use against unsuspecting minds the only real feature that makes outernet different from cable television or the internet is the fact that it is broadcast from a satellite and thus difficult to block in a targeted country and receivable by whomever the us state department takes pilfered tax dollars and buys receiver sets for currently however there is also a lot of very useful information that is being broadcast voted up by legitimate users of the system using the system as it should in theory be used the problem is whenever special interests want they can override the vote and spread propaganda and sedition anywhere on earth it should be noted that projects by google and facebook both partners of the nsa and its information war against humanity have similar plans to outernet they propose roving drones or airships that transmit the internet all over the world like outernets satellite arrangement again it would be assets controlled by the us government and corporations and potentially beyond the reach of sovereign nations targeted by broadcasts and the sedition they are there to support it is clear that at least one foot has been placed in space regarding the ongoing and ever evolving information war other nations are likely to follow suit placing their own broadcasters above the west and beaming down information the west would otherwise like controlled or silenced altogether for the hackers and enthusiasts clamoring over the idea of outernet they cant be blamed but they would be wise to look deeper into who is behind it and think about alternatives they could create to truly realize this concept as it should be and deny these interests yet another noble cause to hide behind and ultimately ruin with their deceit also see ulson gunnar a new york based geopolitical analyst and writer especially for the online magazine new eastern outlook where

1,there is a lot of talk in the past couple years about flaccid paralysis and some viruses going around maiming and killing children mainly in the western part of the usa  as always the finer details are left out things like provocation paralysis meaning all the things that can be done to a body that can make any virus go deeper one of those things is any needle into the muscle at all  the other thing left out of the acute flaccid paralysis conversation is that it used t o be called polio and thought to be caused by a virus called the polio virus causing a syndrome named poliomyelitis  the only problem is that different viruses and toxins can give the same results poliomyelitis or flaccid paralysis  many people think we have done away with polio and iron lungs but we havent the iron lung is now a much more efficient and sophisticated machine called the endotracheal ventilator  if you think that what is going on today with ev d   or any other numbered enterovirus is new please know that it is just history repeating itself because the people in charge of so called public health seem to be completely out to lunch or bought when it comes to seeing the reality  ask yourself why we heard so much about zika and ebola and almost nothing about the reality of todays polio hint which diseases have vaccines in development  polio was the second vaccine i researched on my quest to find the truth i had to do it because so many people scoffed at my doubt over influenza vaccines due to the supposed success of polio vaccines like all doctors my knowledge of polio and any vaccines was very limited

3,which america do you live in   hard to believe facts about wealthy america and poor americamichael snyder for many americans making a choice between buying food for your family and paying the light bill is a common occurrence but if you dont live in that america hearing that people actually live like that may sound very strange to you after all if everyone around you has expensive cars the latest electronic gadgets and million dollar homes the notion that america is in the midst of a very serious economic decline may seem very bizarre to you on wednesday the dow hit a brand newrecord high and wall street celebrated since the financial crisis of   stocks have been on an unprecedented run the top performers in the market have not just made millions of dollars they have made billions of dollars luxury apartments in manhattan and beachfront homes in the hamptons are selling for absolutely astronomical prices and it seems like life in the good parts of new york city is one gigantic endless party these days meanwhile life is quite good down in washington dc as well the wealth is spread more evenly but on average the dc region actually has the highest standard of living of any major us city the reason for this is the obscene growth of the federal government over the past couple of decades the us government has ballooned in size and so have government salaries during one recent year the average federal employee living in the washington dc area received total compensation worth more than    and with the twitter ipo coming up internet euphoria is once again reaching a fever pitch for example just check out what a   year old administrative assistant said this week about why she is going to buy twitter stock im just buying because everybodys talking about twitter she said im just gonna take a chance is that how we should make our investment decisions from now on just buy a stock because everybodys talking about it that is the kind of insanity that is going on in wealthy america right now unfortunately the gap between wealthy america and poor america is greater than ever before cnn recently profiled a   year old overnight prison guard named delores gilmore she works really hard but a lot of times she simply does not have enough money to pay all of her bills the first of the month i pay the rent she said the next check i pay my light bills sometimes i wont pay my rent and i pay the light bill from last month if they cut if it off then i pay the rent the end of the month her life consists of going to work taking care of her children going to sleep and then getting back up and repeating that same cycle once again im not fooling anybody she told me i dont have any friends and thats sad i go to work come home take them where they gotta go if they gotta go somewhere come back home lay down go to work sadly the truth is that tens of millions of americans can identify with what she is going through on a daily basis in millions of families both the husband and the wife work multiple jobs and it is still not enough if we truly did have a free market capitalist system the entire country would be a land of opportunity and things would be getting better for everybody unfortunately that is not the case at all the following are   facts about wealthy america and poor america that are hard to believe   the lowest earning     americans combined make   percent less than the highest earning    americans do     percent of all american workers    percent to be precise make less than    a year   according to the pew research center the top   percent of all us households own   percent of all the wealth in the country   on average households in the top   percent have   times as much wealth as households in the bottom   percent   according to numbers that were just released this week    million americans are living in poverty that is a brand new all time record high   in the united states today the wealthiest one percent of all americans have a greater net worth combinedthan the bottom   percent combined   household incomes have actually been declining for five years in a row and total consumer credit has risen by a whopping   percent over the past three years   according to forbes the   wealthiest americans have more wealth than the bottom   million americans combined   the homeownership rate in the united states is at an   year low   the six heirs of wal mart founder sam walton have as much wealth as the bottom one third of all americans combined   percent of all food stamp dollars are spent at wal mart   according to the us census bureau the middle class is taking home a smaller share of the overall income pie than has ever been recorded before   it is hard to believe but right now    million students that attend public schools in america are homeless that number has risen by   percent since the start of the last recession   one recent study discovered that nearly half of all public students in the united states come from low income homes   in   ceos at sp   companies made   times as much as their employees did on average today ceos at sp   companies make   times as much as their employees do on average in fact there are many ceos that make more than   times what the average employees in their companies make   us families that have a head of household that is under the age of   have a poverty rate of   percent   at this point one out of every four american workers has a job that pays   an hour or less   today the united states actually has a higher percentage of workers doing low wage work than any other major industrialized nation does   approximately one out of every five households in the united states is now on food stamps   the number of americans on food stamps has grown from   million in the year   to more than   million today   at this point the poorest   percent of all americans collectively own just    percent of all the wealth in the united states so

3,debunked ridiculous study claims organic same as conventionalanthony gucciardi they then state that it doesnt matter that conventional foods have higher pesticide herbicide and insecticide levels because they dont exceed legal limits they then fail to mention that roundup monsantos best selling herbicide has been linked to dna damage infertility and over   other associated diseases yet they insist that there is no real difference that is not even taking into consideration the thousands of other studies on pesticides and insecticides such as the   pieces of mainstream peer reviewed research linking pesticide exposure to lower iq apparently these factors dont matter to the stanford researchers who utterly ignored them as they compiled their analysis that actually contradicts itself over and over again the report also admittedly states that organic foods have a drastically lower percentage chance of containing antibiotic resistant bacteria the kind that produces mutant superbugs that cannot be treated with antibiotics the very same kind that have evaded all antibiotics and super drugs and are virtually untreatable by mainstream medicine a new strain of resistant tuberculosis known as the white plaguehas even started to spread that is the result of rampant antibiotic use across the globe conventional farm animals are dosed up with these antibiotics to prevent them from dying as a result of the serious illnesses they come down with the animals are stricken from both eating a poor diet often full of genetically modified grain as well as sitting stationary in a claustrophobic area for years around   of cows in the united states are also injected with monsantos genetically modified synthetic hormone known as rbgh which is banned in   countries worldwide apparently the fact that the genetically engineered rbgh uses molecules and dna sequences that are the result of molecular cloning doesnt matter to the stanford researchers the list could go on and on overall it seems quite apparent that the researchers really have no idea what the word health entails while even the very few aspects they examine seem to heavily favor organic food items the hundreds of other essential factors are wildly overlooked in the report that does nothing but push back the general publics notion of what true health is by about   years explore more
3,crazed cop shooter   explosions   has engineered end of america begunby bernie suarez with isis stories apparently on the side burner and with too much attention focused on the hillary saga and with george soros like the dnc and the clinton foundation before him now exposed for not only funding the black lives matter civil unrest psyop to the tune of   million dollars but also for his agenda to federalize the local police in america all of a sudden in one day the mainstream media is reporting on not one not two but three chaotic stories which given the strong history of staged events weve seen over the past few years could all be psyop events to move the ruling elites plan to create chaos and unrest in america going forward the first of these three events at the time of this article or   hours after the incident takes place in philadelphia where a lunatic unidentified shooter is said to have suddenly and for no particular reason run up to a police car and just started shooting randomly at police officer sgt silvia young sgt young get this gets shot up all over a total of   times and still survives and is in stable condition former police officer ed miller also supposedly gets shot but there is no specific information about this other than were told he too is in stable condition before we get into the other two bizarre and very suspicious stories of the day all truth seekers should pay attention to this first very important point aside from the fact that all the details regarding this shooting are blurry and lack motive and some of the details given are sketchy at best please take notice of who is issuing out or should i say who is controlling the information think lt paul vance sandy hook psyop its this often cited philadelphia police commissioner richard ross so instead of immediately calling this a false flag staged event like so many events today just notice for yourself who seems to be assigned to laying down the narrative this is a huge thing for truth seekers to pick up on think now soon to be former police chief david brown a wild chase and shootout through the streets of west philadelphia on friday night left two police officers and three civilians wounded and a suspect fatally shot on saturday morning the police said another civilian shot during the chase had died philadelphia police commissioner richard ross said sgt sylvia young was ambushed late friday night and shot a number of times in the arm and protective vest ed miller a former police officer who is now a member of the police force at the university of pennsylvania was also wounded ross said both officers were in stable condition early saturday at penn presbyterian hospital one of the three civilians who were wounded was in critical condition the police said the suspect was cornered in an alley and fatally shot by police the commissioner said young a   year police veteran was sitting in her vehicle at about    pm when she was ambushed by the suspect who fired numerous shots ross said young was struck up to eight times multiple times in her protective vest and left arm the suspect fled ross said and shot into a nearby bar striking a security guard in the leg the man then grabbed a woman and used her as a shield before shooting her in the leg moments later as police gave chasethe suspect shot into a car striking a man and a woman in the chest police said saturday the woman died and the man was in critical condition ross said miller and two police officers chased the man into an alley where he was shot and killed the identities of the suspect and the others who were injured were not immediately released authorities said the circumstances surrounding the shooting were unclear kyw tv reports police said they may still be on the lookout for another suspect so aside from one reference at the very end to authorities said the entire story is packed with references to ross said this is often a huge sign of a staged event and its a telltale sign that the story is being carefully delivered by those in control whatever happened to random witnesses oh thats right we now have entire companies whose job it is to stage witnesses at crisis events so realistically who knows how real this event is shot eight times stable condition you decide in another very bizarre story with very sketchy details an unidentified explosion rocked a neighborhood in new york city even worse than the previous story no one seems to know anything about the explosion except two things at least   people were hurt and according to mayor bill de blasio it was intentional read for yourself and see the level of sketchiness and vague details and yet conveniently the only thing they know is that it was intentional ask yourself another question how does the mayor know anything about this explosion at all does he work in law enforcement was he there where is he getting his information from do they not trust the police chief or police commissioner to control the information like the philadelphia police commissioner again where are the actual people who were there why are they not being quoted was this not a normal spontaneous event then where are the testimonies of the ordinary tenants who witnessed the blast surely there must be countless ordinary witnesses an explosion rocked the chelsea neighborhood of manhattan on saturday night injuring at least   people authorities said adding that they are investigating the blast as a criminal act not immediately linked to any terror organization mayor bill de blasio said early indications were that blast was intentional he said the site of the explosion outside on a major thoroughfare of a fashionable enclave in one of the most bustling areas of new york city was being treated as a crime scene but he said there was no evidence of a credible and specific threat to the city we do not see a link to terrorism he added it is too early to determine what the incident was caused by we believe it was intentional a full investigation is under way a law enforcement source said an initial investigation suggested the explosion occurred in a dumpster but the cause was still undetermined the head of the new york police departments special operations division said on twitter that a possible secondary device has been located in the same general area as you can see they are eager to hint terrorism even without any proof whatsoever and finally in yet another bizarre and perhaps even more significant story perhaps designed to remind everyone of the boston bombing psyop false flag a pipe bomb were told exploded in a garbage can in a beach town along a route for a  k race to benefit military veterans which was to take place later in the day again as with the other two stories the details are very sketchy and being delivered or controlled strictly by seemingly designated authorities a pipe bomb exploded in a new jersey beach town on saturday along the route of a charity race to benefit military veterans but no injuries were reported in what investigators were treating as a possible act of terrorism the explosive device went off in a trash can about   minutes after the scheduled start of the race which coincidentally was delayed in seaside park a resort about   miles   km south of new york city officials said no damage to surrounding structures was reported and no runners or bystanders were in close proximity to the    am   gmt blast so no one was hurt authorities said even so the explosion stirred dark memories of the bomb blasts at the finish line of the boston marathon in   that killed three people and wounded more than   others the federal bureau of investigations so called joint terrorism task force assumed the lead role in searching for clues to saturdays bombing asking members of the public for any tips that might lead to arrests in the case brad cohen special agent in charge of the fbis newark field office said at an early evening news conference that investigators had determined there was no longer any threat to the community police chief francis larkin said residents forced from their homes were allowed to return its obvious it was meant to affect the run the fact that it went off at    al della fave a spokesman for the ocean county prosecutors office said in an interview on cnn asked if marines and their families had been targeted della fave said i think we can assume that considering the location of the device right along the run route where if it was just a matter of minutes in terms of difference there would have been a good number of people running past that explosive device the trash can contained several pipe bomb type devices wired together della fave said the one went off and the others did not he said law enforcement authorities said they did not know the motive for the blast another common denominator to all three of these stories is that no one dies all three of these events if they were all staged seem to perfectly serve the same purpose promote fear and terrorism without anyone actually dying my intuition tells me all three of these events were staged with specific police or fbi stooges absolutely controlling the narratives all three stories are vague and have a degree of sketchiness in their details that resemble each other heres something for everyone to think of staging three events in one day is very useful youre ambushing the minds of the general public so that they dont have time to figure any one much less all three stories out just like the texas fertilizer plant missile that blew up the plant just as everyone was sucked into the boston bombing psyop lets not forget that distraction is very much a part of the tactics they use whatever really happened in these events this much is true we must not be fooled by what the desperate ruling elite do with so many bizarre things happening in america like the hillary psyop and the end of america being orchestrated before our very eyes by people like george soros and his black lives matter civil unrest psyop group it is no longer crazy to literally question every single event that the mainstream media floats in our faces in fact it is no longer safe to not question every event fact of the matter is that all three of these events which can and may eventually be linked to terrorism domestic terrorism or even angry black lives matter activists could very well be the beginning of a new wave of gladio b attacks on the innocent people of our country more importantly these are psychological attacks on the people being committed by a ruling class that is determined to stay in power at any cost they have stated clearly they want order out of chaos and these events sound very chaotic especially when all three occur on the same day lets spread the word about this recent ominous and bizarre sequence of events so that americans can be prepared and become more aware of the ruling elites engineered end game agenda particularly as we approach the volatile elections and the period that will follow finally lets remember that order out of chaos will only work if we believe their chaos and if we accept their order bernie is a revolutionary writer with a background in medicine psychology and information technology he is the author of the art of overcoming the new world order and has written numerous

because doing this is the very thing that will ensure victory and restoration of the human race from the rising global enslavement system and will offer hope to future generations this article starts with a claim that its source disputes soros spent   million on black lives matter the source cited has the headline how can anything else be believed after such a fake source why do readers tolerate such shoddy journalism whose sources contradict its assertions oh yeah click bait makes money this is bottom feeding capitalism at its worst it is extremely difficult for the us government to preach protection from terrorism at home when it supports terrorism internationally the us is dancing with the devil and is now getting burned talk about gross hypocrisy domestic terrorism definitely exists its being carried out by the same folks that created isis the us government they never take them out properly jail release jail release people make money that way guess who gets caught in the crossfire they dont care armed insurgence time to rise up and defend liberty and freedom against all tyrants corporate federal state and local there is a clear line that divides free men and women from the oppressor class

2,dolly parton goes public again trashes hillary clinton in amazingly epic fashion dolly parton has long been one of americas most legendary singing and songwriting talents until recently she was fairly liberal and a big supporter of hillary clinton in a statement not long ago parton said she was inspired that a woman might be president for the first time in our nations history were doing good she commented at the time we got a woman that could go in the white house so weve certainly come a long way in that respect recently parton saw the light and realized that hillary would be quite possible the worst person to be the champion for woman throughout the nation she now understands that hillary is a liar shes as corrupt as they come in a more recent interview she called hillary nuts and that her campaign has been just crazy she went on to argue that the american public needs to stop being fooled by hillary lets talk about what we really needtaking care of us dolly saidi think people just want to have a feeling of security its just like political terrorism right now weve got room for improvement what do you think do you applaud dolly for seeing hillary for who she really is
1,if hillary clinton hangs on to win the presidency liberal democrats have vowed to block her appointment of wall street friendly officials to key cabinet and sub cabinet jobs but there has been little organized resistance to her choosing hawkish foreign policy advisers   indeed washingtons foreign policy establishment has purged almost anyone who isnt part of the neoconservativeliberal interventionist group think thats why pretty much everyone who matters agrees about the need to push around russia china syria iran etc   reflecting that attitude sundays lead editorial in the neocon washington post hailed the broad consensus within the establishment for more warlike actions once president obama is gone taking with him what the post calls obamas self defeating passivity   the post praised a new report from the liberal center for american progress which calls for bombing the syrian military and getting tough to counter irans negative influence in line with what all the neocons  as well as israel and saudi arabia  want the next president to do   the absence of any significant counter to this neoconliberal hawk group think represents one of the greatest dangers to the future of the human species since this new hubris comes with a cavalier assumption that nuclear armed russia and china will simply accept humiliation dished out by the indispensable nation   if they dont we can expect official washington to ratchet up tensions in a game of nuclear chicken with the expectation that the leaders in moscow and beijing will bow down to us exceptionalism and slink away with their tails between their legs
1,a molecular biologist who has been cited as a coronavirus expert by the washington post and msnbc has stated in no uncertain terms that the novel coronavirus could have been unleashed on the world due to a leak from a lab at the wuhan institute of virology  chinas top virologist on bat borne viruses shi zhengli has sworn on her life that the virus did not leak from the wuhan lab claiming that its rapid spread is down to nature punishing the human race for keeping uncivilized living habits  but richard h ebright a professor of chemical biology at rutgers university told the daily caller news foundation on thursday that there is a real possibility that the virus entered the human population due to a laboratory accident  daily caller report when asked specifically if he believes the virus could have leaked from shis lab in wuhan ebright said yes  a denial is not a refutation ebright said especially not a denial based on nature punishing the human race for keeping uncivilized living habits  and while shi now tells those who question whether her lab could be connected to the release of the coronavirus to shut their stinking mouths she previously said she lost sleep worrying about the possibility that her lab in wuhan could have been responsible for the viruss release  shi known by her colleagues as the bat woman because of the   years she has spent hunting for viruses in bat caves told scientific american in march that she frantically searched for any evidence that her laboratorys records were mishandled upon learning of the viruss outbreak in wuhan in late december  could they have come from our lab shi recalled thinking  i had never expected this kind of thing to happen in wuhan in central china she noted saying that her studies had shown that southern china posed the greatest risk of coronaviruses jumping from animals to humans  shi said she breathed a sigh of relief when results came back showing that the sequences of the coronavirus did not match the viruses she and her team had sampled from bat caves  that really took a load off my mind shi said i had not slept a wink for days  the wuhan institute of virology is only  km away from the huanan seafood fishery wholesale market where the outbreak is said to have originated  shi and her colleagues at the wuhan institute of virology reported in early   that after five years of surveying they had discovered   new strains of sars related viruses in horseshoe bats from chinas yunnan province the virologist said at the time that the   strains contained all the genes to make a sars coronavirus similar to that of the   outbreak  shi contributed to a study published in february reporting that the novel coronavirus is    identical to a viral strain that was detected in horseshoe bats from the yunnan province  a person wearing a protective suit rides a bike on a wuhan street  however two chinese researchers noted in a separate paper in february that the horseshoe bats that are known to carry the nearly identical viral strain live   miles away from wuhan the researchers also cited testimonies from nearly   people who lived in or visited wuhan saying that the bat was never a food source in the city and no bat was traded in the market  the killer coronavirus probably originated from a laboratory in wuhan the two chinese researchers noted in their paper which was uploaded to research gate on feb    the paper was removed from research gate on feb   or   according to internet archives  the content was uploaded to researchgate by a user who later removed it from the platform beyond this we cannot disclose information about individuals who use our platform research gate spokesman dan noyes told the dcnf  the papers lead researcher botao xiao didnt return the dcnfs emails on thursday seeking comment  ebright the rutgers university molecular biologist told beijing based news outlet caixin global in february that while there is no basis to suspect the virus was engineered the available data indicates that the viruss introduction into human populations could be attributed to either natural causes or to a laboratory mishap  the washington post and msnbc have quoted ebright saying that theories about the virus being a bioweapon should be firmly excluded but neither outlet included his belief that the possibility that the virus entered the human population through a lab accident cannotand should notbe dismissed  shi has furiously denied that the novel coronavirus could have leaked from her lab at the wuhan institute of virology  the novel   coronavirus is nature punishing the human race for keeping uncivilized living habits i shi zhengli swear on my life that it has nothing to do with our laboratory she wrote on a chinese social messaging app in early february according to caixin global i advise those who believe and spread rumors from harmful media sources  to shut their stinking mouths  deadly viruses have a history of escaping from chinese laboratories  the sars virus escaped twice from the chinese institute of virology in beijing in   one year after the virus was initially contained  the chinese government has been widely criticized for misleading the world about the novel coronavirus outbreak from its earliest stages  one of the first doctors in wuhan to raise the alarm about the spread of a sars like virus in the city was detained by police in december and told to stop making false comments  that doctor li wenliang died from coronavirus in february  another chinese doctor ai fen claimed she was silenced by her bosses when she tried to warn about the virus during its early stages ais whereabouts as of sunday are currently unknown according to   minutes australia sparking fears that she has been detained  and on wednesday a top chinese health official announced that the country will begin counting coronavirus cases from patients that show no symptoms a tactic acknowledgment that beijing had underreported its official tally of known coronavirus cases since the start of the pandemic  republican sen tom cotton of arkansas told the dcnf on wednesday it is wholly appropriate to question whether the coronavirus outbreak originated from labs in wuhan that were studying coronaviruses  the reason i have raised these questions from the very beginning is because of chinas statements and their actions cotton told the dcnf after concealing the virus for many weeks in december and then minimizing its severity for most of january they then peddle an origin story about the food market in wuhan  given their dishonesty and the proximity of these labs which we know were working with coronaviruses it is only reasonable and responsible for us to ask the question and demand the answers

3,when the rule of force replaces the rule of law the emerging american gulag systemdave hodges contributor america is witnessing the sovietization of its legal system the similarities are striking undeniable and should prove frightening to all americans the soviet gulag system of justice consisted of two major components the emerging american gulag system of justice consists of two major components the soviet gulag system at the peak of the secret arrests in the  s extreme fear and even paranoia were pervasive in soviet cities it was common knowledge that even intellectuals slept with suitcases of warm clothes and supplies ready under their beds the soviet secret police typically carried out their arrests in the middle of the night when there would be few if any witnesses the soviet citizenry lived in terror of that they would hear the sound of that ominous knock on the door many of those arrested had their fate decided quickly at the hands of a an execution squad those who initially survived the secret arrest were transported to prison camps repression in the soviet union utilized prison camps for political prisoners under the rule of lenin and then later stalin the emerging american gulag system section  b  of the national defense authorization act permits the government to use the military to detain us citizens strip them of due process and hold them indefinitely in military detention centers political prisoners could easily be tortured and executed because who would ever be in a position to report such a heinous crime by the state these inexcusable transgressions against our constitutional liberties could have been easily fixed by congress the senate and house had the opportunity during this past month to include in the   version of the ndaa an unequivocal statement that all us citizens would be exempt from  b  leaving the section to apply only to foreigners however our criminal congress and our criminal president remained silent to the pleas to reform the ndaa in order to conform to the constitution indefinite detention torture and even unsanctioned murder are now legitimized practices of the united states government under section  b  of the ndaa america even has developed their own soviet style informant matrix in a plot hatched by the director of homeland security janet napolitano did anyone else notice what appeared to be chemtrails in the background of napolitanos announcement of the government snitch program at the end of the day the ndaa makes it likely that knocks on american doors followed by the implementation of soviet style justice is in our near future unfortunately this is not where the parallels end consider the following for your approbation forced labor in the soviet re education camps one of the first soviet forced labor camps was the solovetsky special purpose camp slon known as solovki it was at this camp that the idea was hatched of expanding the prison system into a huge network it was found that prisoners could be used for labor at practically no cost to the state because prisoners required no wages and only minimal expense for room and board prisoners could simply be forced to work until they dropped dead the gulag camps rapidly spread across the soviet union in the  s administered by the nkvd the gulag became a state within a state with its own laws government and even its own economy which some speculate may have been larger than the soviet state camps were located in isolated areas many in the vast expanses of siberia where the climate and the land were often fatal to the political prisoners over time most soviet citizens who were sent to siberia never returned the similarities between the old soviet gulags and the american prison system are stunning consider the following contained in a recent expose by truthout as an unidentified female prisoner at arizonas state prison at perryville described her day working as a laborer for a private company called martori farms they wake us up between    and  am and kick us out of our housing unit by   am we get fed at  am our work supervisors show up between  am and  am then its an hour to a one and a half hour drive to the job site then we work eight hours regardless of conditions we work in the fields hoeing weeds and thinning plants currently we are forced to work in the blazing sun for eight hours we run out of water several times a day we ran out of sunscreen several times a week they dont check medical backgrounds or ages before they pull women for these jobs many of us cannot do it if we stop working and sit on the bus or even just take an unauthorized break we get a major ticket which takes away our good time welcome to the administration of justice gulag style how this does not violate the  th amendments prohibition on slavery is a mystery or maybe it is not so mysterious when one considers that the bush family is at the center of privatizing prisons for profit conclusion secret arrests torture and even murder are now part of our legal system but they are only a means to an end the criminal elite must be planning something of monumental proportions to go to the lengths that we are witnessing under the auspices of the ndaa and accompanying gun control legislation the ndaa is not about protecting us it is about protecting the state from us perhaps we should all begin

3,cnn libyan rebels are now isistony cartalucci the so called pro democracy protesters libyan leadermuammar qaddafi was poised to attack in what nato claimed was pending genocide were in fact heavily armed terrorists that have festered for decades in eastern libya almost immediately after nato successfully destroyed libyas government its terrorist proxies were mobilized to take part in natos next campaign against syria libyan terrorists were sent first to nato member turkey were they were staged armed trained and equipped before crossing the turkish syrian border to take part in the fighting cnn admits isis is in libya the black flag of isis flies over government buildings police cars carry the groups insignia the local football stadium is used for public executions a town in syria or iraq no a city on the coast of the mediterranean in libya fighters loyal to the islamic state in iraq and syria are now in complete control of the city of derna population of about    not far from the egyptian border and just about   miles from the southern shores of the european union the fighters are taking advantage of political chaos to rapidly expand their presence westwards along the coast libyan sources tell cnn only the black flag of al qaedaisis has already long been flying over libya even at the height of natos intervention there in   isis didnt come to libya it was always there in the form of al qaedas local franchises lifg and aqim long term bitter enemies of the now deposed and assassinated libyan leader muammar qaddafi cnns latest article is merely the veneer finally peeling away from the alleged revolution it had attempted to convince readers had taken place in   isis didnt come to libya it came from libya even amid cnns own spin it admits isis presence in libya is not a new phenomenon but rather the above mentioned sectarian extremists who left libya to fight in syria simply returning and reasserting themselves in the eastern cyrenaica region cnn also admits that these terrorists have existed in libya for decades and were kept in check primarily by libyan leader muammar qaddafi with qaddafi eliminated and all semblance of national unity destroyed by natos intervention in   al qaeda has been able to not only prosper in libya but use the decimated nation as a springboard for invading and destroying other nations worst of all al qaedas rise in libya was not merely the unintended consequence of a poorly conceived plan by nato for military intervention but a premeditated regional campaign to first build up then use al qaeda as a mercenary force to overthrow and destroy a series of nations beginning with libya moving across north africa and into nations like egypt syria lebanon iraq and eventually iran from there natos mercenary force would be on the borders of russia and china ready to augment already western backed extremists in the caucasus and xinjiang regions in   geopolitical analyst dr webster tarpley in his article the cias libya rebels the same terrorists who killed us nato troops in iraq noted that the us strategy was to use al qaeda to overthrow independent governments and then either balkanize and partition the countries in question or else use them as kamikaze puppets against larger enemies like russia china or iran dr tarpley would also note in   that one of the fatal contradictions in the current state department and cia policy is that it aims at a cordial alliance with al qaeda killers in northeast libya at the very moment when the united states and nato are mercilessly bombing the civilian northwest pakistan in the name of a total war against al qaeda and us and nato forces are being killed by al qaeda guerrillas in that same afghanistan pakistan theater of war the force of this glaring contradiction causes the entire edifice of us war propaganda to collapse the us has long since lost any basis in morality for military force in fact terrorist fighters from northeast libya may be killing us and nato troops in afghanistan right now even as the us and nato protect their home base from the qaddafi government indeed the very terrorists nato handed the entire nation of libya over to are now allegedly prime targets in syria and iraq the pro democracy rebels of   are now revealed to be isis terrorists with long standing ties to al qaeda us long planned to use al qaeda as mercenaries not even mentioning the fact that al qaedas very inception was to serve as a joint us saudi mercenary force to fight a proxy war in afghanistan against the soviet union the terrorist organization has since played a central role in the balkans to justify nato intervention there and as a divisive force in iraq during the us occupation to blunt what began as a formidable joint sunni shiaa resistance movement in   it was revealed by pulitzer prize winning veteran journalist seymour hersh that the united states israel and saudi arabia were conspiring to use al qaeda once again this time to undermine destabilize and destroy the governments of syria and iran in what would be a regional sectarian bloodbath hersh would report emphasis added to undermine iran which is predominantly shiite the bush administration has decided in effect to reconfigure its priorities in the middle east in lebanon the administration has cooperated with saudi arabias government which is sunni in clandestine operations that are intended to weaken hezbollah the shiite organization that is backed by iran the us has also taken part in clandestine operations aimed at iran and its ally syria a by product of these activities has been the bolstering of sunni extremist groups that espouse a militant vision of islam and are hostile to america and sympathetic to al qaeda hersh would note that iran was perceived to be the greater threat and therefore despite a constant barrage of propaganda claiming otherwise al qaeda and its various affiliates were lesser enemies even in   hershs report would predict almost verbatim the cataclysmic regional sectarian bloodbath that would take place with the wests extremists waging war not only on shiaa populations but also on other religious minorities including christians his report would note robert baer a former longtime cia agent in lebanon has been a severe critic of hezbollah and has warned of its links to iranian sponsored terrorism but now he told me weve got sunni arabs preparing for cataclysmic conflict and we will need somebody to protect the christians in lebanon it used to be the french and the united states who would do it and now its going to be nasrallah and the shiites and this is precisely what is happening word for word page by page everything warned about in hershs report has come to pass in   geopolitical analyst dr webster tarpley and others would also reiterate the insidious regional campaign western policymakers were carrying out with al qaeda terrorists disguised as rebels activists and moderate fighters for the purpose of arming funding and even militarily intervening on their behalf in attempts to effect regime change and tilt the balance in the middle east and north africa region against iran russia and china cnns attempt to explain why isis is suddenly in libya is one of many attempts to explain the regional rise of this organization in every way possible besides in terms of the truth that isis is the result of multinational state sponsored terrorism including the us uk eu turkey jordan saudi arabia qatar and israel as its chief backers nato handed isis libya wants to hand isis syria inexplicably amid allegedly fighting isis in iraq and syria the united states now claims it must first overthrow the syrian government despite it being the only viable secular force in the region capable of keeping isis and its affiliates in check cnn in an article titled sources obama seeks new syria strategy review to deal with isis al assad would report president barack obama has asked his national security team for another review of the us policy toward syria after realizing that isis may not be defeated without a political transition in syria and the removal of president bashar al assad senior us officials and diplomats tell cnn neither cnn nor the politicians it cited in its article were able to articulate just why removing syrian president bashar al assad from power would somehow diminish the fighting capacity of isis with cnns recent article on isis gains in libya despite us led nato regime change there after decades of libyan leader qaddafi keeping extremists in check it would appear that nato is once again attempting not to stop al qaedaisis but rather hand them yet another country to use as a base of operations the goal is not to stop isis or even effect regime change in syria alone but rather hand syria over as a failed divided state to terrorists to use as a springboard against iran then russia and china clearly isis appearance in libya negates entirely the already incomprehensible strategy the us has proposed of needing to first depose the syrian government then fight isis the syrian government like that of libyan leader muammar qaddafi is the only effective force currently fighting isis and al qaedas many other franchises operating in the region deposing the government in damascus would compound the fight against sectarian terrorists and the west is fully aware of that therefore attempts to topple the secular government in damascus is in every way the intentional aiding and abetting of isis and the sharing in complicity of all the horrific daily atrocities isis and its affiliates are carrying out the morally bankrupt insidious dangerous and very genocidal plans hatched in   and executed in earnest in   illustrate that isis alone is not the greatest threat to global peace and stability but also those that constitute its multinational state sponsors the very west purportedly defending civilization is the chief protagonist destroying it worldwide tony cartaluccis articles have appeared on many alternative media websites including his own at
2,see the idiotic reasonliberals pushingfor an end to assigning babies a gender when theyre born a recent article written by christin scarlett milloy and entitled dont let the doctor do this to your newborn children may start to be assigned a gender at birth however there may be an extremely slight chance that they will disagree with their gender as they grow early milloys article starts out by discussing a medical procedure in which a doctor explains side effects but parents go through with a mystery medical procedure anyways milloy then attempts to convince the reader that by having your child assigned a gender they are going to die young would you consent to this treatmentfor your child she asks its a strange hypothetical scenario to imagine pressure to accept a medical treatment no tangible proof of its necessity its only benefits conferred by the fact that everyone else already has it and coming at a terrible expense to those   or   percent who have a bad reaction itseems unlikely that doctors hospitals parents or society in general would tolerate a standard practice like this milloy continues on to claim the imaginary treatment i described above is real obstetricians doctors and midwives commit this procedure on infants every single day in every single country in reality this treatment is performed almost universally without even asking for the parents consent making this practice all the more insidious its called infant gender assignment milloy then goes on to argue that when a child is born they are able to do anything or be anything but apparently we hinder this by deciding why they are a boy or a girl she decides to explains why we should rebel against identifying children by their natural sex she doesnt want those who dont identify with their sexuality to be given the harsh label of being a girl or a boy what do you think of milloys ridiculous argument is it absolute nonsense
3,why is jp morgan accumulating the biggest stockpile of physical silver in historyby michael snyder but in recent times the price of silver has actually fallen quite a bit as i write this it is sitting at the ridiculously low price of    an ounce so up to this point jp morgans investment in silver has definitely not paid off but it will pay off in a big way if we will soon be entering a time of great financial turmoil during a time of crisis investors tend to flood into physical gold and silver and as i mentioned just recently jpmorgan chase chairman and ceo jamie dimon recently stated that there will be another crisis in a letter to shareholders some things never change there will be another crisis and its impact will be felt by the financial market the trigger to the next crisis will not be the same as the trigger to the last one but there will be another crisis triggering events could be geopolitical the   middle east crisis a recession where the fed rapidly increases interest rates the     recession a commodities price collapse oil in the late  s the commercial real estate crisis in the early  s the asian crisis in   so called bubbles the   internet bubble and the   mortgagehousing bubble etc while the past crises had different roots you could spend a lot of time arguing the degree to which geopolitical economic or purely financial factors caused each crisis they generally had a strong effect across the financial markets and dimon is apparently putting his money where his mouth is if dimon believes that another great crisis is coming then it would make logical sense to stockpile huge amounts of precious metals and in particular silver is a tremendous bargain for a variety of reasons personally i like gold but i absolutely love silver especially at the price it is at right now over the past few years jp morgan has been voraciously buying up physical silver nobody has ever seen anything quite like this ever before in fact jp morgan has added more than   million ounces of physical silverduring the past couple of weeks alone theyre baaaaackyes old faithful is back at it again of course they never really left silver and have been rigging it non stop in the futures market but for awhile there there were at least no admissionsof newly stacked silver being made in their comex warehousing facilities yet after a   month period of dormancy within their comex warehouse vaultsthese guys have returned with a vengeance in fact our old buddies at jp morgan chase not onlysee value in silver here but theyre currently standing for delivery in their own house account in such strong numbers that it commandsour attention let me show you what i mean heres a breakdown of thecomexs most recent silver deliveries to jp morgan april  th    ounces this is a huge bout of deliveries in such a short space of time in fact within the realm of comex world its such an exceptionally large amount that it even creates quite a spike on the long term chart of jp morgans vault stockpile full report at the wealth watchmanvia steve quayle and realist news do they know something that the rest of us do not meanwhile jp morgan chase has made another very curious move as well it isbeing reported that the bank is restricting the use of cash in some markets and has even gone so far as to prohibit the storage of cash in safe deposit boxes what is a surprise is how little notice the rollout ofchases new policyhas received as of march chase began restricting the use of cash in selected markets including greater cleveland the new policy restricts borrowers from using cash to make payments on credit cards mortgages equity lines and autoloans chase even goes as far as to prohibit the storage of cash in its safe deposit boxes  in a letter to its customers dated april     pertaining to its updated safe deposit box lease agreement one of the highlighted items reads you agree not to store any cash or coins other than those found to have a collectible value whether or not this pertains to gold and silver coins with no numismatic value is not explained what in the world is that all about why is jp morgan suddenly so negative about cash i think that there is a whole lot more going on behind the scenes than we are being told jp morgan chase is the largest of the six too big to fail banks in the united states the total amount of assets that jp morgan chase controls is roughly equal to the gdp of the entire british economy this is an institution that is immensely powerful and that has very deep ties to the us government could it be possible that jp morgan chase is anticipating another great economic crisis we are definitely due for one just consider the following chart from zero hedge it postulates that our financial system is ready for another    year itch what about you are you getting ready for what is coming this article first appeared here at the economic collapse blog michael snyder is a writer speaker and activist who writes and edits his own blogs the american dream and economic collapse blog follow him on twitter here isnt the reason silver is so low that the big banks are manipulating the price because they had so much silver paper out there with nothing to back it up that they were at a huge risk and this allowed them to stock up at a cheaper price e x a c t l y    and who did obama pick as his chief financial advisor about   years ago none other than the former cfo of chase physical silver not to be confused with emotional silver what happened to legal tender for all debts public n private these banks just make up their own rules as they go along huh well they walk all over the playing ground bound by nothing more than avarice and they despise the country and despise its peoplewe dont need banks they

1,one of the worlds richest men jeff bezos has seen a staggering   billion increase in his wealth recently as ordinary americans struggle to put food on the table  just one week after   million hard working americans filed for unemployment amazon boss jeff bezos saw his net worth increase to    billion as amazons stock hit all time highs on tuesday the stock increase was aided by massive fiscal and monetary stimulus flooding the stock market  with historic unemployment numbers on the horizon banks are now warning that loan losses fuelled by job cuts could rival those from the   global financial crisis among the weakest sectors cutting employees first is the very sector that amazon is profiting from retail  bezos is among the top elites who have seen their fortunes soar as the fed continues to focus on its sole mandate of jamming stocks higher  the combined net worth of the worlds   richest people is up an eye watering   from its low on march   as a result  zerohedgecom reports matt maley chief market strategist at miller tabak  co said the wealth gap its only going to get wider with whats going on now the really wealthy people havent had to worry yes theyre less wealthy but you havent had to worry about putting food on the table or keeping a roof over your head  meanwhile corporate insiders continue to buy their own stock at a quick clip indicating that executives believe the worst could be behind us carnival corp board member randall weisenburger for example bought   million of his companys stock in the open market last week  while a couple of big names in oil have seen major losses like harold hamm who has seen his fortune fall   to    billion other executives are experiencing significant gains  bezos has added about   billion to his wealth in   his ex wife mackenzie bezos has seen her net worth climb    billion to    billion elon musk has seen his fortune rise by    billion and the walton family at the helm of wal mart has seen their combined net worth grow to   billion  maley concluded the unfairness of it all is who is going to benefit from it most money makes money  while bezos is getting richer the verge has reported that amazon is going to be making drastic cuts to affiliate commission rates starting next week  amazon is planning to make dramatic cuts to commission rates for its affiliate marketing program which allows media organizations e commerce companies and small and independent businesses to receive a cut of revenue from a sale if a customer lands on the product page and purchases the item through a provided link the cuts go into effect on april  st according to cnbc and some product categories will see drops of more than   percent  the cuts will no doubt come as a blow to digital media companies who spent time building out infrastructure to recommend users buy products from amazon the verge notes that companies like buzzfeed and new york times owned wirecutter are among the more prominent commerce providers in the industry  so we guess we can expect negative op eds from those blogs at some point soon  finally recall yesterday we reported that amazon had fired   employees who spoke out about working conditions at the company during the coronavirus pandemic the company confirmed that it had fired emily cunningham bashir mohamed and maren costa for violating company policy  amazon commented we support every employees right to criticize their employers working conditions but that does not come with blanket immunity against any and all internal policies we terminated these employees for repeatedly violating internal policies  with regard to mohameds firing the company stated this individual was terminated as a result of progressive disciplinary action for inappropriate language behavior and violating social distancing guidelines  that or perhaps amazon just found their lack of faith in the jeff bezos best intentions disturbing
1,there are only weeks left until we find out if we have a president trump or a president clinton donald trump is perceived as the candidate who is against the corrupt establishment while hillary clinton is seen as part and fabric of the establishment and as the most corrupt candidate to run for president in the history of the country  a president clinton in a few weeks would return us to the hostile climate towards india that we saw in the  s overseen by her husband after he took office in   the us relationship with india went on a considerable down slide for nearly a year clinton did not bother appointing an ambassador to india even as he went about opposing india on multiple fronts leading to anger in the indian establishment initially he was intent on disarming and weakening india by preventing access to technology and also mounted a sustained attack on the indian economy by imposing several economic sanctions  in   senator joe biden who is now the vice president under barack obama introduced an amendment in the bill granting aid to russia making the aid conditional on the fact that russia could not sell cryogenic engines for indias space programme the clinton administration was hellbent on hurting the development of indias space and technology sectors and blocked the sale of cray supercomputers that had been approved under the ronald reagan administration india was also targeted for several economic sanctions and was threatened under what was called the super   clause of the american trade law  these economic sanctions were specifically borne out in the way mr clinton attacked the indian textile and carpet industries throughout the  s the terms dunkel draft super   wto and patent laws became synonyms for the us attempts to retard the indian economy and led to many protests in india  by   india was justified in believing that indo us relations had hit the lowest point but things took a dramatic turn for the worse during bill clintons second term in office madeleine albright became the new secretary of state and she was increasingly hostile to india especially through her pseudo racist television outbursts in fact she loved attacking india so much she went at it after leaving office and called for a plebiscite in kashmir justifying the actions of violent groups in the process
4,lee chien min had long acted like a big shot at taiwans largest airport but no one dared to disturb him until recently after a lawmaker blew a whistle on his abominable behavior how could he a supervisor at taoyuan international airports central control center have kept his job for so many years were where government authorities scandals related to the airport have emerged with increasing frequency amid widespread public complaints about its dilapidated facilities and lax management reflecting long term negligence by the government with peddlers selling lunch boxes and clothing around the clock inside the airport and lee drinking and flirting with female workers while on duty it has looked more like a night market or nightclub than a major gateway in a democratic country in the  st century how could a civil servant act like a despot while on duty we dont know the answer but it must be rotten culture of our government agencies or lax discipline engendered over many years that has led to the degradation of the bureaucracy taiwans people are the unfortunate ones because lee was only removed from his supervisory post when he retires taiwans taxpayers still need to pay his pension until his death and the death of his spouse many average taiwanese earn far less than lee so why arent they getting angry could it be that we are even more contemptible than lee july

4,pakistan may be buoyed by a push against the taliban in swat but analysts warn the islamist threat cannot be quashed without a determined assault against militants entrenched in the tribal belt three suicide car bombings that left   people dead in the northwest in the past week show a new taliban leadership willing and able to inflict carnage while key militant chiefs remain at large despite multiple offensives the taliban remain a dangerous force capable of causing a great deal of damage a recent editorial in english language paper the news said the war begun against them must continue there can be no let up there will have to be a campaign in waziristan it added referring to the wild semi  autonomous region where islamist rebels hold sway for years pakistans military has oscillated between launching offensives against islamist insurgents and signing peace deals with the rebel leadership holed up in the lawless tribal belt that borders afghanistan but the march of militants across the one time tourist playground of swat and neighbouring districts advancing to within   kilometres   miles of islamabad in april this year sparked a fierce air and ground onslaught with more than    militants reported killed the government in early july said the verdant valley was almost cleared of the taliban threat next in the militarys sights was the tribal region of khyber the fabled land route into afghanistan and the main supply line for the more than    us and nato troops fighting in pakistans war stricken neighbour helicopter gunships and paramilitaries thrust into khyber on september   targeting lashkar e islam army of islam a homegrown militia led by former bus driver mangal bagh which has loose links to the taliban military spokesman major general athar abbas said the operation was essential as militants fleeing other offensives in swat and nearby districts were coming and taking refuge in this agency analysts and local residents however question how successful the khyber operation has been when no high profile targets have been captured or killed everybody knows where mangal bagh is living    why dont they go after him and target him khyber resident jamil afridi told selfnews now the army claims to be mopping up there and looming on the horizon is the prize of north and south waziristan    the main bastions of the taliban leadership and also a hideout and training ground for al qaeda fighters in the case of khyber the army thinks they succeeded easily however in areas like south waziristan their strategy is different said hasan askari a visiting professor at johns hopkins university they dont want to get in there until they are very sure of a walk over the timing of any waziristan offensive remains a mystery us secretary of state hillary clinton is scheduled to visit pakistan in mid to late october a possible catalyst for pakistan keen to impress its western ally the military has already launched sporadic air assaults in the area and blockaded roads and abbas said they are keen to exploit infighting after taliban warlord baitullah mehsud was killed in a us missile strike in august if its weakening your adversary then the better strategy is first to allow that weakness to be fully settled there so it will be a matter for military judgement what is the right time for the ground offensive said abbas the big question is whether the military has the manpower to push into waziristan while sustaining a presence in swat where the army has vowed to stay until april   a september report by washington based think tank the new america foundation said that between    and    more troops would be needed in the tribal and northwest region to meet the insurgent threat currently    of the    strong armed forces are in the area traditionally pakistan has focused its military might toward arch rival india and troops are still packed along the border while pakistan still views india as its main threat the report said the military will probably take a default position on the tribal areas clearing out extremist elements of the taliban using current tactics while seeking to cut deals with more moderate elements

1,nancy pelosi took a seriously nasty pop shot at president trump on friday accusing him of instructing americans to inject lysol into their lungs  the president is asking people to inject lysol into their lungs and mitch mcconnell was saying that states should go bankrupt its a clear visible within   hours of how the republicans reject science and reject governance pelosi said during the friday presser  clearly and sadly this president is not listening to medical experts  later towards the end of the presser the nasty house speaker declared no money for the post office instead inject lysol into your lungs  watch  queen nancy pelosi cant land a zinger on donald trump without deliberately misquoting him twitchys headline said unlike nancy pelosi whose doctor apparently told her to tell people to go to chinatown as covid  was spreading  daily wires ben shapiro destroyed the speaker by tweeting no money for small businesses instead eat artisanal ice cream  no money for small businesses instead eat artisanal ice cream httpstcosqknnxj zz  ben shapiro benshapiro april      shes a ridiculous person trump didnt tell people to inject lysol and mcconnell said that if states racked up tens of billions in debts unrelated to coronavirus it is absolutely not the federal governments responsibility to bail them out but slay queen or whatever shapiro continued  shes a ridiculous person trump didnt tell people to inject lysol and mcconnell said that if states racked up tens of billions in debts unrelated to coronavirus it is absolutely not the federal governments responsibility to bail them out but slay queen or whatever httpstcolhr czy c   ben shapiro benshapiro april      madworldnewscom reports guy benson editor at town hall also crushed poor nancy two dumb distortions despite irresponsible rantings from potus mcconnell is the last adult in the room  two dumb distortions despite irresponsible  rantings from potus mcconnell is the last adult in the room httpstcohlrkxag ja  guy benson guypbenson april      do any of these democrats and press understand what chemotherapy and radiation is injected into people every day tweeted clouseau  httpstwittercominspektorclousestatus   this lysol reference got so crazy the company that makes the disinfectant came out with a warning  the parent company of lysol and another disinfectant warned friday that its products should not be used as an internal treatment for the coronavirus breitbart reports  trump noted thursday that researchers were looking at the effects of disinfectants on the virus and wondered aloud if something similar could be injected into people saying the virus does a tremendous number on the lungs so it would be interesting to check that  that prompted a strong warning from the maker of disinfectants lysol and dettol which said it was issuing a statement to combat recent speculation  as a global leader in health and hygiene products we must be clear that under no circumstance should our disinfectant products be administered into the human body through injection ingestion or any other route said the statement from reckitt benckiser  researchers are testing the effect of disinfectants on virus laden saliva and respiratory fluids in the laboratory said william bryan of the department of homeland security they kill the virus very quickly he said  and is there a way we can do something like that by injection inside or almost a cleaning trump said because you see it gets in the lungs and it does a tremendous number on the lungs so it would be interesting to check that so that youre going to have to use medical doctors with but it sounds  it sounds interesting to me  the press attacked president trump once again after nancy pelosis remarks  reuters reporter jeff mason asked the president to clarify whether he was encouraging americans to ingest disinfectants and trump replied no of course not  while pelosi and her cohorts jumped on the bandwagon to make the crazy accusation that the president told americans to inject lysol they are the ones who are looking mean spirited and petty during a national emergency  doctors who specialize in cancer can verify that chemo therapy is the process of injecting toxic substances into their patients hoping to kill the cancerous cells the side effects are brutal as they also destroy good cells in the process radiation therapy is the same thing  so maybe speaker pelosi should learn a lesson with her grandstanding americans will never support any politician who is belittling the man who is clearly doing everything he can to get this country through a horrible situation

4,prior to president ma ying jeous departure from taipei may   for his central america tour of belize guatemala and el salvador mainly to attend the june   inauguration of el salvador president elect mauricio funes he said at the airport that the journey proves that his advocacy of pragmatic diplomacy is working although he did not elaborate observers knew ma was referring to taiwans relations with el salvador after funes won the presidency fears had mounted in taiwan that he might follow through on hints during his election campaign that he would switch diplomatic recognition from taipei to beijing the potential crisis was quickly defused however by china giving an apparent cold shoulder to funes paving the way for mas trip the pillar of mas pragmatic diplomacy which he calls a modus vivendi strategy is seeking a diplomatic truce with china mas administration has never actually disclosed how it plans to define the concept of a diplomatic truce with beijing much less strike an agreement on the issue the president has simply made public appeals that neither side should woo the allies of the other the war for diplomatic turf between taiwan and china began as an extension of the civil war between the kuomintang kmt and the chinese communists after the gunfire ended in   with each side vying for recognition as the only legitimate regime governing china it raged even harder after the democratic progressive party dpp took power in taiwan in   after a half century of kmt rule alarmed by the dpps support for taiwan independence beijing stepped up its efforts to quash taiwans international presence and any hints alluding to the countrys sovereignty in its eight years in power the dpp administration under former president chen shui bian lost nine allies to china while gaining three resulting in an overall decline in the number of its allies from   in   to   in   the fight for diplomatic allies provided shrewd politicians in small mainly impoverished third world states with a chance to play one side against the other alternating their loyalties between the two countries to squeeze maximum gains for their countries or themselves this led to a bidding war with both sides pitching for the other sides allies with open wallets    the notorious checkbook diplomacy    which only went to prove in a number of cases that money could not buy long term friendship for example the south pacific island nation of nauru switched its recognition from taipei to beijing in   and then back to taipei in   chad a cash  strapped african state restored official ties with taiwan in   and severed them in   senegal also in africa resumed ties with taipei in   and terminated them in   but the game grew increasingly costly when beijing persuaded costa rica to abandon taipei in   it pledged to purchase us  million worth of the central american countrys bonds and to provide us  million in direct aid this diplomatic maneuvering involved a large amount of backroom deals and gave corrupt local and foreign politicians ample opportunity to grease their palms notable examples include two middlemen who made away with us  million provided by taiwans foreign ministry after saying they could help the country forge ties with papua new guinea in   in another glaring example that came to light former national security council secretary general chiou i ren was accused of seizing us   from a us   million secret fund set aside by the foreign ministry to win the friendship of world trade organization director general supachai panitchpakdi of thailand in   rather than enhancing the countrys international profile these secret diplomatic dealings tarnished taiwans global image ma vowed to get rid of this practice on may   during his visit to belize ma lambasted chens administration for engaging in checkbook diplomacy and made a pitch for his own administrations pragmatic diplomacy he also said that any diplomatic breakthrough for taiwan depends on a breakthrough in its ties with china foreign minister francisco ou believes beijing will buy mas idea of a diplomatic truce    if that is china puts a premium on its ties with taiwan with more than   allies around the world beijing can hardly increase its prestige by winning one or two of taiwans allies but doing so would cost china goodwill from taiwan ou said beijing has not agreed to a truce with taiwan but it has refrained from luring away any of taiwans   remaining allies since mas inauguration in may   in addition to el salvador paraguay and panama have also flirted with the idea of changing their allegiances but have not followed through on their threats possibly after also being given the brush off by china in ous view beijing should not only forsake any attempt to lure away taiwans allies but should also reject any countries who approach beijing seeking recognition or it will inevitably harm taipeis trust in beijing mas diplomatic truce with beijing has also given taipei more leeway in dealing with its allies requests for aid according to ou although taiwan is willing to help its allies our ambassadors are now capable of asking their host countries to come up with detailed plans and practical requests for grants the minister said however jaushieh joseph wu taipeis representative to the united states in former president chen shui bians administration dismissed mas vow to give up checkbook diplomacy as mere rhetoric according to wu the diplomatic budget of mas administration is no less than that of the preceding government and in fact it has spent even more in some countries although mas administration hasnt lost any allies thus far it is traveling on a dangerous path as it has given up any efforts to win new friends out of deference to what it calls its truce with china wu said meanwhile beijing is going to great lengths to improve its ties with taiwans allies which could easily be converted into official ties wu warned forsaking efforts to foster friendship with non allies and pinning all hopes on beijing is very dangerous he pointed out taipeis abrupt reconciliation with beijing has also embarrassed those of its allies that have spoken out for taiwan in its struggle with china and has baffled other countries that are friendly to taiwan wu claimed they dont know whether they should continue to extend their support to taiwan wu further speculated lo chih cheng a political science professor at soochow university in taipei said the success of mas diplomatic truce should not be judged simply by the number of allies the country can count what matters is taiwans substantive ties with countries that do not officially recognize it lo said by this measurement president ma can hardly claim any progress because his leading ministers are still forbidden from setting foot in countries that are allies of beijing    which contrasts sharply with mas encouragement to taiwans allies to forge unofficial ties with beijing he said it doesnt take a diplomat to see who gets the upper hand from the truce he went on lo took particular issue with mas criticism of his predecessors checkbook diplomacy in belize describing his comments as unbecoming for a head of state it is more a piece of campaign rhetoric than a diplomatic statement suggesting that our allies have got a lot of mileage out of taiwans dispute with china  he said it remains to be seen how long mas truce with china will last what is obvious however is that the war of words surrounding it will not end any time soon

3,shock fracking used to inject nuclear waste underground for decadesaaron dykes and melissa melton fracking is already a controversial practice on its face allowing us industries to inject slurries of toxic potentially carcinogenic compounds deep beneath the planets surface as a means of see no evil waste disposal already sounds ridiculous dangerous and stupid anyway without even going into further detail alleged frackinglinks to thecontamination of the public water supply and critical aquifers as well as ties to earthquake upticks near drilling locations that are otherwise not prone toseismic activity have created uproar in the years since the   cheney loophole which allowed the industry to circumvent the safe drinking water act by exempting fracking fluids thus fast tracking shale fracking as a source of cheap natural gas now it is apparent that the fracking industry is also privy to many secrets of the nuclear energy industry and specifically where the bodies are buried err dangerous nuclear waste is buried rather waste that atomic researchers have otherwise foundso difficult to eliminate truthstreammediacom uncovered severalpublished newspaper accounts from the spring of   concerning a then newly disclosed plan to dump nuclear waste produced by the atomic energy industry into hydraulic fracturing fracking wells using a cement slurry technique developed by halliburton co the top two fracking companies in the nation at the time were halliburton and dowell a subsidiary of dow chemical and here we thought fracking was a relatively new industrial phenomenon growing in popularity over just the last couple of decades boy were we wrong revealed within these articles is halliburtons long standing relationship with the secret government and deep ties between the oil and nuclear industries teaming up with the us government and union carbide corp who operate nuclear materials divisions at the oak ridge national laboratories in tennessee halliburton was then credited with solving the radioactive waste problem faced by americas secretive nuclear industry dumping waste via fracking had apparentlybeen going on since   according to the reports but was only madepublic here in   out of sight out of mind each of the articles truthstream foundcarries the same account under different headlines with four of them using identical copy and the fifth published in the san antonio express slightly rewritten based upon the same source information the photo captions of each story also add some useful tidbits these ran in the april     edition of the great bend tribune the april     edition of the warren times mirror the april     edition of the lubbock avalanche journal the may     edition of the san antonio express news original and the june     edition of the denton record chronicle the story read in part researchers at halliburton cos technical center here working with oak ridge national laboratory scientists have combined the oil well cementing technique with the hydraulic fracturing production stimulation technique to entomb radioactive wastes in an impermeable shale formation a thousand feet underground the method used at oak ridge begins by mixing the waste with a cement slurry pumping the mixture down a hole drilled into the conasuaga shale and then fracturing the shale to create a horizontal crack the crack fills with the mixture to form a thin horizontal sheet several hundred feet across the mix sets to permanently hold the radioactive waste in the formation union carbide corp which operates facilities at oak ridge for the us atomic energy commission and halliburton which provides specialized oil field services such as cementing fracturing worldwide have collaborated on the project since   the mix remained liquid for   hours before it was supposed to permanently set and remain there entombed forever the articles make clear that the atomic energy commission was preparing to use fracking as a means of disposing of nuclear wastes at additional facilities with oak ridge being simply one of the largest and the first to publicly disclose these out of sight disposal procedures among the disposal methods already tried have been dumping concrete encased barrels of waste in the ocean or burying the waste in lead lined containers these are considered either too dangerous or too expensive or both the slightly different version in the san antonio express news added these details final tests are now under way at oak ridge national laboratory in tennessee in trying a combination of oil well cementing plus hydraulic fracturing to entomb radioactive wastes in an impermeable shale formation a thousand feet underground meanwhile the great bend tribune added information about the halliburton executives involved in the plan in their caption for a photo which shows businessmen looking at a diagram explaining how nuclear waste like strontium   is mixed with cement and injected into shale formations the process includes remote controlled operation of the hydraulic fracturing drill in order to shield workers from the medium level radioactive substances being dumped into the earths crust as the warren times mirror in pennsylvania notes in the caption how often this procedure has been used at other facilities since then is not entirely clear though we know from reports discussed below that the practice continued and there is no indication that it ever stopped five years later the october     edition of the san bernardino county sun carried a report titled   ways to manage radioactive waste it discussed the ongoing and growing problems with nuclear waste naming three principle strategies for managing the toxic stuff summed up as   delay and decay   concentrate and confine and   dilute and disperse discussing how materials with lower half lives can supposedly be safely sequestered and later dumped while other materials can be simply diluted and poured into existing groundwater supplies and systems the upi story originating out of oak ridge states in part and scientists here and elsewhere around the nation still are wrestling with the problems of what to do with this material which promises to become even more plentiful as more and more commercial nuclear reactors go into power production oak ridge proclaims that it found a solution to dealing with high level nuclear wastes which has thus far been to keep it it is in this area of confining the high level wastes whose radioactive half life ranges up to   to   years that the atomic energy commission is pushing dramatic new concepts note this article cites a shallower depth at levels as shallow as   feet after the   articles claimed a further removed depth of    feet to    the even higher level wastes were disposed of in abandoned salt mines according to oak ridge nuclear waste safely flushed away into the water supply the   article states that low level waste is material which can safely be flushed away into rivers and lakes or released into the atmosphere because the level of radioactivity is so low that is presents no hazard when diluted and flushed into mans natural environment the more difficult problem is involved in the high level liquid and solid wastes which are produced in the reprocessing of used fuel elements from nuclear reactor cores the idea that the waste dumped into water supplies was so low level as to be completely harmless is likely dubious and hopeful at best fluoride a by product of the nuclear power industry was one of those constituents and was transformed from being known as a rat poison to being known as a dental benefit by the original spin doctor and propagandist edward bernays in his book the fluoride deception author christopher bryson revealed how the nuclear industry also used fluoridation of the public water supply as a means of secretly dumping industrial waste after fluoride was a major by product in the uranium enrichment process for building the atomic bomb bryson told democracy now more recently an associated press investigation found in   that   of   nuclear sites in the united states were leaking tritium a radioactive form of hydrogen into groundwater supplies via corroded pipes and tunnels ap found at least   locations were in direct violation of federal drinking water standards for tritium in some cases hundreds of times over fracking nuclear waste safe for millions of years unless it leaks some   trillion gallons of toxic waste has been kept out of sight out of mind by us industries that have injected it hundreds and thousands of feet underground into wells since the  s scientists who work for these corporations have used computer modeling to assure the environmental protection agency that this waste poses no threat to our aquifers and that layers of rock deep within the earth would safely store this stuff like tupperware for millennia already several incidents have proven that scientific computer models are no match for reality it is clear from adecember     article that disposal of nuclear waste via fracking continued along withpromises that it would be safe for millions of years to come the dixon evening telegraph wrotein geologists look at energy crunch that is as the article points out unless there are leaks as wefound in research leakage isexactly what has happened time and again throughout the years including at disposal sites for oak ridge national laboratories according to reports in the following cases via propublica a year later a corroded hazardous waste well for pulping liquor at the hammermill paper co in erie pa ruptured five miles away according to an epa report a noxious black liquid seeped from an abandoned gas well in presque isle state park in   in beaumont texas dioxin and a highly acidic herbicide injected underground by the velsicol chemical corp burned a hole through its well casing sending as much as five million gallons of the waste into a nearby drinking water aquifer and these are hardly the only examples in fact it is just scratching the surface of an issue that is almost as incomprehensible as it is unfathomable bingo there it is the infallible permanent and impermeable deep injection wells that halliburton and the atomic energy commission considered as a solution to nuclear waste for eons to come were found turning up radioactive nuclear waste at the very oak ridge site where these  s disposal projects were taking place subterranean waste disposal a cornerstone of the nations economy those cemented wells filled with injected disposal substances may be safely secured for a few years or even decades but that is no guarantee for the years down the road and its certainly not the millennia as promised by halliburton and others in the industry in fact many of the wells have been forgotten abandoned and are lost to the record books as propublica reports and many of these are injection wells where all kinds of unwanted toxic substances are dumped in order to be forgotten though not necessarily gone not only are these practices taking place they are widespread and widely defended even with the known failures and safety issues subterranean waste disposal they point out is a cornerstone of the nations economy relied on by the pharmaceutical agricultural and chemical industries its also critical to a future less dependent on foreign oil hydraulic fracturing clean coal technologies nuclear fuel production and carbon storage the keystone of the strategy to address climate change all count on pushing waste into rock formations below the earths surface source please read propublicas full series of reports on this starting here things have to change these people should not have started messing with something they did not know how to fully and safely manage how long can this madness continue until it winds up taintingevery drinking glass in america engineer mario salazar who worked as a technical expert for   years with the epas underground injection program in washington told propublicas abrahm lustgarten something that should give us all pause about how radioactive nuclear waste and industrial pollutants in general are being handled and where they may ultimately end up in   to   years we are going to find out that most of our groundwater is polluted a lot of people are going to get sick and a lot of people may die aaron and melissa created truthstreammediacom where this article first appeared as an outlet to examine the news place it in a broader context uncover the deceptions pierce through the fabric of illusions grasp the underlying factors know the real enemy unshackle from the system and begin to imagine the path towards taking back our lives one step at a time so that one day we might truly be free i always have thought that shooting radioactive waste to the sun was an possibility taken up with regular shuttlespace station re supply trips but i dont know any particulars or cautions

1,a hillary clinton goon destroyed donald trumps star on the hollywood walk of fame  the peaceful man said that he had     family members assaulted and that hes terrible upset that he has a presidential nominee who is a poster child for sexual violence people were standing around and filming his brave act we imagine it took several minutes to accomplish this yet no one intervened no one called the cops  most of the fake accusers have already been debunked but batshit crazed liberals still push on the narrative that trump is a rapist  this is a classic tactic from saul alinsky of whom hillary clinton idolized and based her college thesis on divert attention away from your issues with the same issue but falsely accusing it on your opponent nice  so hillary wants to divert attention away from her open marriage and from her husbands rapes of multiple women with false accusations of trump make no mistake about it this is not a trump issue she would have done the same thing with any other opponent if it were ted cruz same story if he would have exposed bill clintons rapes the next week you would have had multiple women falsely accusing ted cruz of raping and groping them unbelievable  the vandal identified himself as james otis and he removed the emblem from the middle of the star to sell it and donate the money to all the women who were raped by trump  you would think that in the light of project veritas videos and how they exposed the dnc evil who paid agitators violence voter fraud and more they would chill out for a while but nope the viciousness is going on these people are pushing the limits of law in this country and as of now its a banana republic led by banana boy obama but if trump gets in a lot of people are rightfully going to be locked up and have the key thrown away for all this chaos anarchy and lawlessness  lapd is currently searching for the vandalism suspect  trump received his star in   in july   a protester built a   inch wall around the star which is a legitimate form of protest but destroying the star is just anarchy and that man needs to be locked up for a while along with the democrats who paid him to do that  the hollywood chamber of commerce said they are planning to repair the star well at least they have some honor in them  people can make a difference by voting and not destroying public property the chambers president said  these sort of things are normally expected to happen in poor countries with little to no freedoms where the opposition party is systematically oppressed but in a country like america which brags to the world how it is the greatest democracy in the world it is surely setting a bad example which no one in its right mind would like to follow

3,brexit and goals and ops of the deep stateby jon rappoport speaking of money making money the hysterical aftershocks in trading markets right after the brexit victory was projected are all synthetic and artificial manipulations laid on to prove a point see what happens when a country defects from the new order meanwhile the people who had real jobs yesterday still have them today life goes on britain will still be able to engage in trade with other countries despite obamas warning that theyll have to stand in the back of the line to make deals with the us nonsense blather obama is failing in his job as front man for rockefeller globalists if he cant get senate ratification on the tpp and the ttip deals now hell be the cfrs failure of the decade hillary who came out against brexit is looking like a clown with egg on her face sowhat is britain leaving when it leaves the eu its departing a giant robot a structure of untold numbers of sub androids bureaucrats who have been making life miserable for europe higher debt unlimited migration blizzards of regulations grim political correctness all in the service of a coming utopia of course the real job of the eu is dehumanizing people for the sake of humanity thats how faceless robot bureaucrats operate the eu is an illusion of authority in the sense that it pretends to be in exclusive possession of knowledge that will make life better for all of europe the eu built itself as a machine a structure so maze like so complex that it must be valuable it resembles a super computer we have trillions of pieces of vital data we can plan the future more competently than any smaller entity leave the details to us the eu is in all these ways a copy of the deep global state of which it is a part and now we come to the second section of this article which i wrote first as i was becoming aware of the result of the brexit vote consider it background the deep state has of course not gone away a much greater degree of dismantling is necessary technocracy itself has to be understood and defeated because it is the leading edge of the new globalist society the state is now involved in making people into robots and robots into people behind all the technological promises and heraldry this is whats happening people are already beginning to feel a fierce unshakable loyalty to machinesand a religious adoration up the road robots will be wise counselors and guides and priests this is civilizations version of magic technocracy and theocracy are the same op they are rule by fictional figures and the knowledge supposedly possessed by these figures doesnt exist whether a person or a machine can dispense three pieces of information or three trillion and whether the dispensing takes a year or a microsecond the authority surrounding the dispensing is window dressing it doesnt have any inherent power its laid on in the same way a movie set is built or a green screen is deployed to confer authenticity the following two statements are remarkably similar the pope is infallible super computer xyz is infallible the latter statement is a modern substitution for the former it wouldnt be a great surprise at some point to witness the election of a pope that is a computer the college of cardinals might discuss whether to present him as a robot wearing the official costume of office they might even decide this robot should ride in the bubble mobile with its protections to avoid damage vatican technicians would assure the pope uttered from time to time humanitarian messages in a credibly human voice on the other side of the op as humans are fitted into tighter slots in the new planetary order they would more and more resemble machines in thought and action losing their individuality through sacrifice for the greater good they would naturally seek out signs and signals of what they no longer hadand they would find those human traits in robot computers which would be built with great care to deliver an imitation of life sit a very young child down in front of a crude robot called a television set and show her an animated cartoon of cinderella dancing in the hall of a great palace and the child experiences trance like ecstasy why up the road wouldnt a sufficiently mechanized adult find the same joy viewing an animated hologram of a remarkably convincing robot that hands out ideological imperatives on the oneness of all creatures on earth on the subject of taking individuality from humans and placing it into robots every one of our androids is different our company believes in imbuing each of our messengers with a unique set of characteristics this isnt a sales technique were dedicated to the mission of diversity personality isnt something to be buried under a surface of sameness and conformity it should be front and center after all our robots are conscious they arent but who pauses to notice wave after wave of fictional propaganda is launched to make the case that machines are alive the major target of the campaign is the educated class it is now an established fact that evolution took place through higher and higher orders of information processing functions indeed the complexity of processing is the definition of consciousness gibberish in this technological and pragmatic civilization many humans already consider themselves first and foremost problem solvers however recognizing their skills are lacking especially when it comes to personal issues people are more than willing to surrender the job to machines computers will provide undeniable answers and advice of course to make this system work the problems and the people will have to be reduced down to manageable proportionsflattened short circuited cartoon ized people will need to see themselves as biological machines with only a handful of basic needs and some historian will one day write humans were operating on flawed self destructive programs the best of them realized this and so out of need and desperation they invented machines that could guide them and work around those errors this was the patch that was laid on until we could precisely identify both the programs and the flaws flush them out of the system and install new software in the brain this is the future unless individuals with the power they actually do have reclaim what is theirs and dump the whole ridiculous apparatus the euthat machineis one small part of the whole op it is a machine whose purpose is turning humans into robots and robots into humans thats the bottom line of highly centralized authority

1,former obama administration attorney general eric holder has given the democrats game away with a single comment  the chilling remarks from holder bears a strong resemblance to an infamous quote attributed to obamas chief of staff rahm emanuel who disturbingly quipped in   you never want a serious crisis to go to waste and what i mean by that is an opportunity to do things that you think you could not do before  in an interview with time magazine published this week holder the ag who spent six years ignoring the rule of law in the obama white house tried to sell his radical ideas as pro democracy and making elections more inclusive  but what holder is actually talking about is dismantling the longstanding checks and balances used to ensure the integrity of the voting system  coronavirus gives us an opportunity to revamp our electoral system so that it permanently becomes more inclusive and becomes easier for the american people to access holder said  it would be foolhardy to take these pro democracy measures off the table after we get on the other side of the virus these are changes that we should make permanent because it will enhance our democracy  westernjournal report what are the pro democracy measures holder is so ardent about measure like voting by mail and no excuse absentee ballots  the kind of voting reforms democrats champion that would make national elections so open to tampering and fraud that they could be subject to endless challenges  as townhalls beth baumann pointed out thursday the whole idea of mail in ballots on a nationwide scale is ripe for fraud  the practice of ballot harvesting allowing literally anyone  including paid political operatives  to collect ballots from voters and turn them in for counting basically destroys the protection of the voting booth  there is no way of knowing for sure whether the person voting was doing so of their own free will or even if the person whose ballot was being cast was the one who actually filled it out  the practice paid off handsomely for democrats in california in the   midterms even the san francisco chronicle  not exactly a right wing news outlet  attributed major democratic gains in the golden state that year to ballot harvesting  the one thing we never hear about from these democrats is about voter fraud we dont hear about ballot harvesting baumann wrote the issue with ballot harvesting in itself is it allows political operatives to collect and return ballots theres no way to know if those operatives are actually turning in peoples ballots or if theyre magically losing the ballots of those who oppose their candidate or their cause  then theres the issue of voter identification whos to say that the person who filled out the ballot is the registered voter theres no one to double check that information no one has to produce any kind of identification its based entirely on the honor system  its doubtful there has ever been a time and a place in american history where the honor system was a reliable method of conducting elections  some version of the democrats after all has been around since the earliest days the republic  but even if there has been it hasnt been within the living memory of anyone who will be voting in november  what holder and his supporters care about isnt the integrity of any election or the secret ballot that makes an honest completely independent individual vote possible or a system of voter registration that makes sure those casting a vote are legal residents of the country or the jurisdiction that theyre voting in  democrats dont care at bottom about how an election works they care about the results  and the results of the   midterms in california are exactly the kind of results the country can expect writ large if the party manages to use the confusion surrounding the coronavirus crisis to rewrite the rules of american electoral politics  theyre not regretful about it in holders case they can sound actually giddy at the prospect for leftists a crisis is an opportunity  and as holder told time magazine leftists have no intention of letting the coronavirus crisis go by without trying to capitalize on it

3,un biotrade turning africa into financial resource for global governancesusanne posel contributor the uns environment program unep released a report entitled the global environment outlook geo   the geo   took three years to complete it is the uns health check on earth and encourages world government leaders to enact more stringent environmental mandates within their countries to combat their effects on the planet achim steiner un under secretary general and unep executive director warns that time is running out as the worlds population comes closer to   billion people as expected by   steiner claims that as larger amounts of natural resources are expected to be consumed the planets safety is at stake if current trends continue if current patterns of production and consumption of natural resources prevail and cannot be reversed and decoupled then governments will preside over unprecedented levels of damage and degradation the unep would like governments to redirect their focus on the factors driving climate change the unep is centering their attention on africa and asia where climate change is being felt most according to the geo   report the uns goals for sustainable development in africa and asia center on their population growth water supplies and food security the sub saharan and northern regions of africa latin america the caribbean and parts of asia are of particular interest to the un as stated by unicef and the world health organization who the uneo will prop up the sustainable development division of the un the same agency that disseminates agenda   policies to governments will be centralized into a global agency with powerful international backing as the unscientific assertions of a global environmental crisis vanishing biodiversity and over population become more urgent to the un the insertion of international governance is being covertly added into the mix as the answer to solve all problems worldwide with the assistance of the un corporations have begun descending on africa to aid in the securitization of their natural resources examples like an   million dollar project funded by the bill and melinda gates foundation and the coca cola corporation are usurping    kenyan and ugandan smallholders to produce fruit for minute maid a subsidiary for coca cola africa is now the last frontier in terms of arable land said james nyoro the rockefeller foundations managing director for africa with the population growing to   billion the rest of the world will have to depend upon africa to feed it researchers for the british geological survey bgs and the university of london have uncovered underground aquifers of water in africa that are   times the amount found on the surface of the continent and have written a paper in the environmental research letters journal the created a detailed map of the underground water this discovery is the largest attempt at water privatization by governments and international governances the unep is also creating a project with the capacity building for the biotrade project cbbt their concerns are with the use collection production and commercialization of goods and services for use and trade that expressly derived from the native biodiversity plants species and organisms in our environment the unep seeks to control the trading of these products to make sure they are cultivated in line with their definition of social environmental and sustainable as the desire for natural products in the cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries becomes more popular the un wants to gain control to secure profits and production standards speaking at the un earth summit netumbo nandi ndaitwah  the minister of environment and tourism hopes that biodiversity could become an even greater asset for sustainable pro poor development in namibia nandi ndaitwah promotes policy reforms and financial investments from the public and private sectors targeted at namibias key biotrade products and services through the use of multinational corporate relationships control over the use of agricultural land in rural areas and implementation of biotrade policies research and development the land grabbing by the un will soon become extremely lucrative the unep has also announced that they are investing in green projects under the african carbon asset developmentacad facility and expansion plans acad is looking for financial investors along with their current holders stand bank to re enlisted in the public private partnership sylvie lemmet director of uneps division of technology industry and economics is excited about the expansion plans unep is pleased to announce the expansion of acad and recognizes that much work still needs to be done to help african green entrepreneurs access carbon finance we are thrilled to have helped not only bring good projects to fruition but also to have supported the african financial sector evaluate the potential of innovative carbon projects these latest developments suggest a strong vote of confidence in acad and signal africas emergence as a fully fledged carbon market player these plans for the acad originated by provisions of the german governments international climate initiative by investing a facility that will seed the opportunities for more funding following suit is the french government who is negotiating to contribute through the french global environment facility administered by the agence franaise de dveloppement the un has enacted a carbon credit scheme under the registration of large scale wind power projects in africa multinational corporations are financing this plan to mandate led lights to rwandan households acad will focus their global carbon sector and green economy schemes through africa because of its natural resources these projects are slated to attract commercial funding that will expand the acads reach acad is africas first project development support facility dedicated to increasing carbon project deal flow while the unep risoe centre on energy climate and sustainable developmentis leading unep activities related to carbon finance and the clean development mechanism

4,suspected maoist rebels derailed a high speed train packed with sleeping passengers into the path of a freight train in eastern india friday killing at least   people it was the latest in a series of deadly maoist attacks that have put the government under intense pressure to consider deploying the military as it struggles to contain the growing left wing insurgency police warned the death toll would rise with dozens more bodies feared trapped in the mangled wreckage after   carriages of the mumbai bound express from kolkata careened off the tracks in a remote area of west bengal railways minister mamata banerjee said the train had been derailed by a very severe bomb blast but officials said they were also looking at evidence that metal plates used to secure adjoining sections of track had been removed it is a clear case of sabotage the maoists have done it west bengal police chief bhupinder singh told reporters at the crash site he said maoist leaflets had been found scattered by the tracks another senior police official helping coordinate the rescue operation said emergency teams had recovered   bodies and the fear is that there will be many more police inspector general surajit kar purakayastha told selfnews more than   people were reported injured some of them in critical condition four of the carriages that slammed into an oncoming goods train were badly crushed and flipped on their sides with body parts clearly visible amid the twisted metal rescue workers with bolt cutters struggled to free anyone still alive inside one survivor vinayak sadna said he had been sleeping when his carriage lurched violently to one side and then flipped over flinging passengers around the compartment i ended up stuck between two seats with an iron bar crushing my hand sadna said i was trapped for three hours before i was pulled out my wife is still missing another distraught passenger ranjit ganguly who was travelling to mumbai for a holiday with his family said he had been thrown from his carriage by the impact but his daughter and son were trapped inside paramedic teams treated the injured on the side of the track while the most serious cases were evacuated by air force helicopters the incident occurred at around    am   gmt thursday in the district of west midnapore    a maoist stronghold around   kilometres   miles west of kolkata state chief minister buddhadeb bhattacharya said the attack underscored the need for a review of the federal governments counter insurgency strategy we have to find ways to counter the maoist menace innocent people are being killed he told a press briefing in kolkata in a bid to reverse the growth of the insurgency the government launched a centrally coordinated offensive in november   dubbed operation greenhunt using more than    paramilitary and state police the operation has produced little in the way of tangible results and the maoist attacks have continued unabated triggering growing calls for the army to be brought in home minister p chidambaram    who has borne the brunt of public criticism over the handling of the insurgency    recently acknowledged that changes were needed and said he would request wider powers the maoist rebellion began in west bengal state in   in the name of defending the rights of tribal groups and has since spread to   of indias   states prime minister manmohan singh has labelled it the biggest threat to the countrys internal security in april the rebels ambushed and killed   policemen in the central state of chhattisgarh in the bloodiest massacre of security forces so far by the extremists fridays incident was the worst loss of life on indias enormous rail network since   people were killed in october when a delhi bound express ploughed into the back of passenger train near the taj mahal town of agra
2,liberals have major meltdown after straight white guy festival planned as we have all seen in the media gay pride protests are being held more and more frequently all around the country these rallies are designed to encourage homosexuals to be proud and open about their sexual orientation in todays world even if someone politely disagrees with the homosexual lifestyle they are bashed by the public but what if the tables were turned according to the washington times ohio park will be the first ones to push those limits as they host the straight white guy festival this kind of think implies theres some kind of struggle going on for being a straight white person in ohio michael premo gay marriage supporter told the post straight white people are doing just fine i think it detracts from the real problems of ohio that need to be solved that are being denied their constitutional rights because of who they are or who they love now while some liberals are angry and speaking out against the event others admit that it is a joke that is making a point and it does beg the question why is it okay to be proud of being gay but not proud of being straight what do you think is this just another double standard
3,a return to the madness of madby brett redmayne titley again absolutely all politics are reduced to white or black there is no gray all peoples of our world again exist within a fateful clash between only two distinct ideologies best summed up as good vs evil right vs wrong life or death a mere generation ago the colors of worldwide military polarization were then thrust upon the innocent by mad politicians with similar delusions of empire who then portrayed their geo political expansionism in the easily understood colors of red vs blue east vs west the cold war the once soviet empire vs the ever since burgeoning us contra empire the multitude of issues separating the two supposedly separate doctrines of red or blue ultimately distilled into one single horrific doctrine of military nuclear madness that all on earth finally by the necessity of self preservation truly understood to increase the perceived terror of their new doctrine of horror these politicians announced an all too accurate acronym that translated their man made horror into a simple definition no sane person could ignore a doctrine of pure madness one trumpeted by treasonous politicians and readily admitted to by their military leaders in the name of final world victory mad mutually assured destruction ours suddenly the citizens on either side of the iron curtain were faced daily with a very real very personal threat a terror haunting their nightmares while a military nuclear build up pushed forward globally to all the moral world the issue of this terror was not red vs blue but pure and simply the black of heartless men not the white of conscience and humanity all knew for the future of man this nuclear madness had to be stopped or else and so it was the citizens of the countries of the world rose up together day after day year after year the mind set of the world changed in december of   the doomsday clock of armageddon that had ever ticked forwards towards oblivion each new year seemingly for a lifetime was thankfully for the first time moved backwards the destruction of man was no longer assured this day brought on further gains such as the strategic arms reduction treaty start and the nuclear non proliferation treaty npt and with them the seeming end of the era of nuclear madness for the first time in memory the world relaxed with a collective sigh of overdue relief the threat was over white had defeated black sanity nay humanity  had overcome both blue and red that call to order has sounded again the madmen have returned the rhetoric screams of an intention to practically declare war on russia they us military only talk about defense but in fact they are preparing an offensive mikhail gorbachev nato has been under direction from washington dc for the inception of many recent wars re branded as conflicts much the same can be said of the united nations as american diplomatic hegemony leads to the further placement of us missile systems surrounding russia what was once a post cold war promise by the us and nato not to use former soviet bloc nations for offensive military purposes has left barely a handful not pointing us provided guns back at a targeted russia it can be argued correctly that beginning with the shootings at maidan square ukraine and continuing to gaza palestine in   these two obama backed war crimes of atrocity began an epiphany of the world public but also of world leaders then the willful barbarism of the odessa massacre next flight mh  disappeared literally and then mh  was shot out of the sky along with   peoples futures following these atrocities was the us propagation support and funding of the un holy terror  pure evil personified isis daesh currently libya and iraq wallow in us inspired political and military chaos all this took place with five years of obama inspired syrian slaughter as a daily backdrop wrapped in a controlled american medias many depths of deliberate gray obfuscation the truth is so graphic that it has clearly been revealed to the remaining moral world the collective hidden american message america places no value whatsoever on human life yours the world of gray is not working the predictable cover up of all these and many other us approved atrocities fails to fool the world nor its conscience any longer instead these examples show clearly to all which two countries truly lead the worlds expanding dark and immoral minions in a black and white world not shrouded in media gray the answer is obvious america and israel three years on from maidan square a massive worldwide defensive military build up is taking place in countries directly under us threat countries that have previously tried peace appeasement and diplomacy such as russia iran and china have all had their own recent maidan epiphanies finding instead their efforts their leaders and their countries in turn demonized they now realize their us declared enemy is not interested in any technique of political communication other than the singular language of war terror and death talks that began at washingtons behest immediately post maidan with warsaw romania bulgaria and hungary about the permanent stationing of us army equipment warehouses including heavy weapons have all come to fruition in the last few months despite violating the post soviet nato accords with these actions russia finds itself thanks to us control of these former russian satellites increasingly surrounded ever closer to its own borders consider the developments of this past week all within rocket distance from moscow on saturday july       nato leaders agreed to the alliances biggest military revamp since the cold war claiming a resurgent russia they vowed to unite behind a hard headed policy of deterrence and dialogue with russia proving their point romania and poland immediately received funding and began installing us land based missile systems circling to the southeast nato secretary general jens stoltenberg announced that the pentagon has budgeted    billion in annual us funds to pay for    afghan forces with the kabul government contributing an additional sum of around   million for a total yearly budget of nearly   billion this belies of course that the us has been there done that to near zero effect but does highlight the continued us attempt to surround russia with american war power stoltenberg stated the united message is that defense and dialogue are what our relationship is based on really this week a us guided missile destroyer uss ross equipped with the aegis advanced missile defense system entered the black sea heading to the ukrainian port city of odessa to join the international maritime exercises sea breeze   along with bulgaria greece lithuania italy poland romania turkey the uk georgia and ukraine a statement issued by the russian foreign ministry seemed more accurate a preliminary analysis of the results of the meeting shows that nato continues to exist in some sort of military political looking glass world whats a peaceful nation to do for iran the chicanery of us negotiators during the p   nuclear treaty negotiations has not stopped with its passage and correctly reinforces strong suspicions this past week the us congress reneged on this signed treaty by imposing new sanctions refusing to cancel sanctions listed in the treaty and introduced new anti iran legislation despite the promised reprieve from the crippling us sanctions that resulted in the deaths of over a million iranians the iranian leadership had maintained diplomacy and satisfied all the five other signatory nations but despite obama signing for the us what should be a historic peace agreement congresspersons blustered with scripted hatred and promises of regime change and military intervention whats a peaceful nation to do americas third declared enemy china is getting quite tired of us incursions into their air space and into their territorial waters us naval ships continue to deliberately provoke conflict regarding the spratly islands in the south china sea less than five hundred miles from chinese turf make no mistake this is not a turf war this is an oil warthe recent move by the south korean side has harmed the foundation of mutual trust between the two countries reuters cited chinese foreign minister wang yi as telling his south korean counterpart yun byung se emphasizing their rising suspicions the us this week sent a full navy battle group to maintain close proximity to the spratlys also us reconnaissance planes have taking a liking to encroaching on chinese air space and disturbing commercial flights last month the us imposed a   tariff on chinese steel imports whats a peaceful nation to do underscoring the current post maidan worlds change of heart china last week announced it will now shift from territorial air defense to both defense and offense we have prepared ourselves for the most dangerous scenarios  brig general hossein salami lt commander the islamic revolution guards corps irgc indeed since maidan an unprecedented military build up has accelerated globally by those who are under threat of american expansionism this build up has covered six major facets iran particularly has showcased marked achievements in all six areas over the past two plus post maidan years now displaying a formidable array of new military advancements with its educational system on the rise and having already achieved world rankings of  th in nanotechnologies and  th in production science it is not surprising that iran has so quickly introduced a wide battery of new military defenses as well these include cyber warfare drone technology and remote controlled attack speed boats with american hegemony seeming to have no bounds these build ups are also taking place from venezuela to pakistan brazil to india but the true horror lies not in the build up of long since mislabeled conventional weapons dispersed across the borders of the globe there is now only one primary threat there is only one political issue that issue is pure black not one shade of gray it is nuclear where have all the people gone my honey  from morning dew composed by bonnie dobson in resisting the american militarys pivot to asia read china its encroachment of russias western flank by nato and the persistent attempts to manifest war with the iranian leadership it is the prudent preventative measures of these three leading nations that show to the remaining free world clearly that one they now well understand this threat and two they must prepare for it the nuclear threat of the cold war era was a different threat however during those anxious times the threat of mad was an implicit bluff bluffing that no world leader red or blue would be so callous so cruel so immoral as to be the one to press the button thereby dooming their enemies and millions of their own countrymen to certain death and nuclear winter this bluff was based on one existing fundamental of all men humanity love of life in those by gone times of daily implied armageddon although tested several times on the razors edge of geo politics humanity triumphed no trembling hand could find then the will to apply a calloused finger to the final button of global termination that was long ago today by any metric of the post maidan era america has shown that it has foregone all considerations with respect to innocent life or humanity world populations are merely collateral damage of a rampaging american hegemony in the societal charge of criminal insanity depraved indifference to human life is considered therefore any leader of a nation that finds collateral death of the innocent to be acceptable is guilty as charged hence we are dealing with madmen according to data exchanged under new start requirements as of october     the united states had    deployed strategic warheads compared to    for russia the number of deployed icbms slbms and strategic bombers the means to deliver the nuclear horror for the united states was   compared to   for russia america long ago ignored its moral obligation under the nuclear non proliferation treaty npt which it joined in   and which was extended indefinitely on may     instead it used twisted language to justify a massive nuclear upgrade to make its existing arsenal more threatening to the world the cost which is in addition to this years    billion dollar military budget is of course secret hence russia and china have followed suit certainly these concerns about future nuclear actions of america were only increased when the current american congress and senate provided massive and of course secret funding to move norad north american aerospace defense command back inside cheyenne mountain colorado this is the bunker created deep inside a solid granite mountain in   said to be able to withstand a direct nuclear strike norad was sheltered there until   when the threat of nuclear retaliation was then minimal cheyenne mountain also had another sinister purpose to house in comfort presumably until plant life outside was able to grow again the leaders of the free world those leaders whose populations were likely dead or dying in the smoldering gray remains of morning outside the madmen so leaders in iran russia and china are under an offensive us nuclear threat they have been forced by obligation of national self preservation to shift to offensive weapons including the nuclear option the result of this offensive reactionary deterrent is indeed the return in sad practicality to the doctrine of mad one of the nuclear response weapons that china has recently begun testing is a hypersonic nuclear weapon delivery system the wu   a test of the hypersonic glide vehicle was carried out on june   and is the missiles fourth test in   months the strategic strike weapon is extremely advanced and can travel at   times the speed of sound or    kph the wu   is capable of maneuvering during flight while traveling at the edge of space and so is extremely difficult to shoot down in russia production of the tu   blackjack supersonic strategic bomber and missile carrier will resume with updated improvements according to defense minister sergey shoigu further in   russias new   ton silo based heavy ballistic missile sarmat began undergoing its initial tests on december     in his address to the federal assembly russian president vladimir putin set objectives for the countrys military policy russia aims to maintain its military advantage prioritize the rearmament of its nuclear deterrence forces and refit up to   percent of its military hardware by   this policy is obviously moving rapidly with the ultra hawkish brookings institutions steven pifer admitting russias strategic modernization program today appears to far outpace us efforts it is national resources that are the difference between the american set of allied nations and those they seek to conquer these invading countries are of an aging empire bankrupt in all resources normally part of any flourishing nation these destitute nations economies and banking industries are on the brink of collapse their natural resources terminally and forever depleted exports in contraction gdp in recession unemployment growing to revolutionary levels the moral and social wealth of their countries corrupted their people increasingly impoverished and their laws optional and plutocratic the aging empire has very little left so it would steal using their armies from those countries who have in abundance all of what the empire lacks what it has thrown away a future so the madmen are desperate a desperate man with nothing to lose is capable of any insanity at any moment post maidan we need not see more although preparing it is doubtful that russia china and iran nations with so many assets and prosperous national futures will cast aside their respect for humanity after years of renewing flourishing societies as russian president putin expressed succinctly to italian news outlet il corriere della sera i think that only an insane person and only in a dream can imagine that russia would suddenly attack nato i think some countries are simply taking advantage of peoples fears with regard to russia fear on jan     the nuclear doomsday clock of armageddon suddenly moved forward two minutes two full minutes it stands now at three minutes to midnight the return to the madness of mad cannot be covered from our eyes in shrouds of the lies of gray for since maidan the issue of mad is a sirens scream sent from the souls of all the past victims of empire it pierces the ears whether we listen we hear it on the winds of change the forgotten howl with a lonely cry the dead scream a warning the madmen have returned image credit anthony freda art  the end  about the author brett redmayne titley has been reporting on scene for a decade in an effort to provide better

3,the double edged sword of drone technologytony cartalucci as the nsa builds an omnipresent surveillance network across the planets surface tracking each and every one of us ranking us autonomously into various threat categories with the most dangerous brought to the attention of human operators fleets of drones can endlessly circle overhead with the ability to strike us down at any moment such a society is technically already here while drones are not killing americans on american soil they are killing americans on foreign soil under just such a premise while the justification today is terrorism and the villains easily hated by most americans and their deaths just as easily shrugged off this can and already is being incrementally changed the centralized nature of telecom and the current monopoly the state holds over drone technology ensures that this nightmare only gets darker the solution even the odds the civilian use of drones goes beyond their use by police and non military government agencies news teams both corporate and alternative are increasingly turning to drone technology to cover events as they unfold in bangkok thailand during protests seeking to oust wall street proxy thaksin shinawatra alternative news agencies used drones not only to cover events from unique and compelling perspectives but to gather intelligence on the strength and disposition of police loyal to the regime with this information available to all on youtube via drone footage released of clashes filmed from above better strategies could be developed against the regime saving time energy and even lives drones are being deployed agriculturally by independent farmers to give them a better idea of how their crops are fairing and insight on how to better manage their fields with the resources they have or may require mits technology review in an article titled agricultural drones stated drones can provide farmers with three types of detailed views first seeing a crop from the air can reveal patterns that expose everything from irrigation problems to soil variation and even pest and fungal infestations that arent apparent at eye level second airborne cameras can take multispectral images capturing data from the infrared as well as the visual spectrum which can be combined to create a view of the crop that highlights differences between healthy and distressed plants in a way that cant be seen with the naked eye finally a drone can survey a crop every week every day or even every hour combined to create a time series animation that imagery can show changes in the crop revealing trouble spots or opportunities for better crop management this out of box capability may already be helping farmers today but the hackability of drone technology means that these automated camera platforms may soon be helping in other bigger ways diy drones asking for drones to be regulated or otherwise outlawed will only result in the technology remaining solely in the hands of those abusing it most instead activists fearing a dystopian future where drones prowl the skies and strike us down without warning and with absolute impunity should commit themselves to democratizing drone technology in other words taking ownership over it and ensuring no monopoly of any kind can be had over it people have already been developing their own drones as part of personal projects at universities as school projects or part of technological collectives known as makerspaces or hackerspaces the concept of diy drones is gaining momentum as the technology used to construct and hack automated or semi autonomous aerial platforms becomes cheaper and easier to use there in fact exists an entire community onlinediydronescom that provides a good cross section of the increasingly impressive results hobbyists makers and hackers are achieving the website also serves as an invaluable resource for those seeking to build their own projects while many commercial kits offered to farmers today serve as advanced imaging systems hackers could potentially augment these drones with the ability to do everything from managing pests pulling weeds and checking hydration to providing security alerts and even automated harvesting that puts not a single footprint or tire track upon fields other applications could include painting maintenance meteorology and even constructionin both rural and urban settings balance of power before the need even arises to create fleets of locally produced and armed drones a fully educated population that has successfully democratized drone technology will already pose a counterweight to the unmitigated use of drones by monopolies awareness alone will limit the impunity these monopolies currently enjoy today however with an increasing number of people capable of producing their own drones countermeasures to armed drones and their abuse will increase as well not only within any given country but between countries as well the monopoly the united states enjoys today will be hindered first by other nations developing their own drone programs and then by the expansion of civilian uses and an increasingly educated and technologically competent population for those that fear and detest the use of drones by governments and corporations as an extension of their monopolies greed and ambitions to control others the battle should not be to un invent drone technology but to disseminate distribute and democratize it to provide the ultimate check and balance sentinels created by and for local communities could be used for security and weather observations today but the ability for them to be transformed into self defense systems tomorrow would be an ever looming threat hegemonic powers would have to enter into their calculus the watchers can be watched the trackers can be tracked and the executioners can be eliminated but only if drone technology can be embraced and democratized not feared and allowed to remain monopolized when we do grant ourselves the ability to watch track and eliminate the drones sent to watch track and eliminate us we may find the balance of power such an ability achieves makes actual confrontation entirely unnecessary for it was the ancient chinese warlord sun tzu who said best the greatest victory is that which requires no battle tony cartaluccis articles have appeared on

3,should we just follow orders rules of engagement for resisting the police statejohn w whitehead the perils of resisting the police state grow more costly with each passing day especially if you hope to escape with your life and property intact the thing you must remember is that weve entered an age of militarized police in which were no longer viewed as civilians but as enemy combatants take for example mary elizabeth vandenberg who was charged with disturbing the peace a crime punishable by up to   days in jail and a   fine for daring to vocalize her frustrations over a traffic ticket by reading a prepared statement to the court clerk and paying her   traffic ticket with   one dollar bills vandenberg was also handcuffed tasered and pepper sprayed for passively resisting police by repeatedly stopping and talking to them and stiffening her arms the incident filmed by vandenbergs brother is now the subject of a lawsuit zachary noel was tasered by police and charged with resisting arrest after he questioned why he was being ordered out of his truck during a traffic stop because im telling you to the officer replied before repeating his order for noel to get out of the vehicle and then without warning shooting him with a taser through the open window the encounter recorded with a cell phone by noels friend in the passenger seat offers a particularly chilling affirmation of how little recourse americans really have when it comes to obeying an order from a government official or police officer even if its just to ask a question or assert ones rights eighteen year old keivon young was shot seven times by police from behind while urinating outdoors young was just zipping up his pants when he heard a commotion behind him and then found himself struck by a hail of bullets from two undercover cops despite the fact that the officers mistook young    lbs and guilty of nothing more than taking a leak outdoorsfor a   tall   lb murder suspect whom they later apprehended the young man was charged with felony resisting arrest and two counts of assaulting a peace officer what these incidents make clear is that anything short of compliance will now get you charged with any of the growing number of contempt charges ranging from resisting arrest and interference to disorderly conduct obstruction and failure to obey a police order that get trotted out anytime a citizen voices discontent with the government or challenges or even questions the authority of the powers that beand thats the best case scenario the worst case scenario involves getting probed poked pinched tasered tackled searched seized stripped manhandled arrested shot or killed so what can you really do when you find yourself at the mercy of law enforcement officers who have almost absolute discretion to decide who is a threat what constitutes resistance and how harshly they can deal with the citizens they were appointed to serve and protect in other words what are the rules of engagement when it comes to interacting with the police if you want to play it safe comply and do whatever a police officer tells you to do dont talk back dont threaten and dont walk away in other words dont do anything that even hints at resistance keep in mind however that this is not a fail safe plan especially not in an age where police officers tend to shoot first and ask questions later oftentimes based only on their highly subjective feeling of being threatened and are reprimanded with little more than a slap on the wrist indeed the news is riddled with reports of individuals who didnt resist when confronted by police and still got tasered tackled or shot simply because they looked at police in a threatening manner or moved in a way that made an officer fear for his safety for example levar edward jones was shot by a south carolina police officer during a routine traffic stop over a seatbelt violation as he was in the process of reaching for his license and registration the trooper justified his shooting of the unarmed man by insisting that jones reached for his license aggressively if compliance isnt quite your cup of teaand wed be far better off as a nation if we were far less compliantthen youve got a few more options ranging from legal but sure to annoy an officer to legal but it could get you arrested to legal but it could get you shot if this is warand a good case could be made for the fact that the government is indeed waging a war on the american citizenrythen the tactics im about to outline could be considered nonviolent guerilla warfare using whatever strategic legal creative and nonviolent means are available in order to outmaneuver an opponentin our case the american police forcewhose language is the language of force to begin with and most importantly americans need to know their rights when it comes to interactions with the police bearing in mind that many law enforcement officials are largely ignorant of the law themselves in a nutshell here are your basic rights when it comes to interactions with the police as outlined in the first ten amendments to the us constitution you have the right under the first amendment to ask questions and express yourself you have the right under the fourth amendment to not have your person or your property searched by police or any government agent unless they have a search warrant authorizing them to do so you have the right under the fifth amendment to remain silent and not incriminate yourself you have the right under the sixth amendment to request an attorney depending on which state you live in and whether your encounter with police is consensual as opposed to your being temporarily detained or arrested you may have the right to refuse to identify yourself presently   states do not require citizens to show their id to an officer drivers in all states must do so however knowing your rights is only part of the battle unfortunately the hard part comes in when you have to exercise those rights in order to hold government officials accountable to respecting those rights as a rule of thumb you should always be sure to clarify in any police encounter whether or not you are being detained ie whether you have the right to walk away that holds true whether its a casual show your id request on a boardwalk a stop and frisk search on a city street or a traffic stop for speeding or just to check your insurance as i point out in my book a government of wolves the emerging american police state if you feel like you cant walk away from a police encounter of your own volitionand more often than not you cant especially when youre being confronted by someone armed to the hilt with all manner of militarized weaponry and gearthen for all intents and purposes youre essentially under arrest from the moment a cop stops you still it doesnt hurt to clarify that distinction as kahler nygard learned nygard was threatened with arrest for failing to comply with an order by tsa agents to undergo additional screening after flying with no incident from minneapolis to his final destination in denver it turns out that nygard at one time a vocal critic of the government had been placed on a special list requiring him to undergo extra airport screening when airport officials realized that they had failed to carry out the additional screening prior to nygards departure they attempted to cover their mistake by screening him once he landed to the annoyance of the government agent nygardwho filmed the entire encounterrepeatedly asked the agent whether he was being detained or not once he deduced that the tsa had no legal rationale for detaining him nygard walked away without incident the encounter might have ended far differently had a police officer been standing nearby however another important takeaway from nygards experience is to record your encounter with police while technology is always going to be a double edged sword with the gadgets that are the most useful to us in our daily livesgps devices cell phones the internetbeing the very tools used by the government to track us monitor our activities and generally spy on us cell phones are particularly useful for recording encounters with the police and have proven to be increasingly powerful reminders to police that they are not all powerful no matter what individual police officers might say to the contrary members of the public have a first amendment right to record police interactions as the justice department recognized in a   memorandum acknowledging that recording governmental officers engaged in public duties is a form of speech through which private individuals may gather and disseminate information of public concern including the conduct of law enforcement officers that said there may still be consequences for filming the police as fred marlow learned the hard way marlow was charged with interfering and resisting arrest and fined    for daring to film a swat team raid that took place across the street from his apartment marlow was asleep when he heard what sounded like multiple bombs blasting and glass breaking rushing outside to investigate marlow filmed police officers dressed in army green camouflage standing beside an armored vehicle in the process of carrying out a swat team raid to serve a search warrant more than    such raids take place every year in the us for such routine police procedures as serving search warrants ordered to return inside or face arrest for interference marlow explained that he was on his own property and could be outside he was subsequently arrested one popular alternative to citizens filming police encounters is having the police wear body cameras which have been proven to decrease the number of use of force incidents and citizen complaints when used properly unfortunately given that they can be turned off as easily as they are turned on these devices are also ripe for abuse not to mention the fact that they are privacy threatening roving extensions of the surveillance state whose cameras are conveniently pointed at us not them clearly the language of freedom is no longer the common tongue spoken by the citizenry and their government with the government having shifted into a language of force we the people have been reduced to suspects in a surveillance state criminals in a police state and enemy combatants in a military empire in such an environment as every resistor from martin luther king jr and on down the line has learned there is always a price to be paid for challenging the status quo then again the price for not challenging the status quo is even worse outright tyranny the loss of our freedoms and a totalitarian regime the likes of which the world has never seen before

3,nsa director finally admits encryption is needed to protect publics privacyby carey wedler on thursday rogers told the atlantic council think tank encryption is foundational to the future though surveillance officials dont often champion privacy rogers emphasized the importance of encryption and the need to incorporate it into security practices concerns about privacy have never been higher trying to get all those things right to realize that it isnt about one or the other he said though he maintained that privacy should not be the dominant concern he also rejected the belief that security is the imperative and that ought to drive everything adding weve got to meet these two imperatives weve got some challenging times ahead of us folks rogers cited the recent office of personnel management hack of over   million users as a reason to increase encryption rather than scale it back what you saw at opm youre going to see a whole lot more of he saidreferring to the massive hack that compromised the personal data about   million people who obtained background checks rogers comments while forward thinking signify an about face in his stance on encryption in february   he said he shares fbi director james comeys concern about cell phone companies decision to add encryption features to their products comey has been one loudest critics of encryption however rogers comments on thursday now directly conflict with comeys stated position the fbi director has publicly chastised encryption as well as the companies that provide it in   he claimed apples then new encryption feature could lead the world to a very dark place at a department of justice hearing in november comey testified that increasingly the shadow that is going dark is falling across more and more of our work though he claimed we support encryption he insisted we have a problem that encryption is crashing into public safety and we have to figure out as people who care about both to resolve it so i think the conversations in a healthier place at the same hearing comey and attorney general loretta lynch declined to comment on whether they had proof the paris attackers used encryption even so comey recently lobbied for tech companies to do away with end to end encryption however his crusade has fallen on unsympathetic ears both from the private companies he seeks to control and from the nsa prior to rogers statements in support of encryption thursday former nsa chief michael hayden said i disagree with jim comey i actually think end to end encryption is good for america still another former nsa chair has criticized calls for backdoor access to information in october mike mcconnell told a panel at an encryption summit that the united states is better served by stronger encryption rather than baking in weaker encryption former department of homeland security chief michael chertoff has also spoken out against government being able to bypass encryption regardless of these individual defenses of encryption the intercept explained why these statements may be irrelevant left unsaid is the fact that the fbi and nsa have the ability to circumvent encryption and get to the content too by hacking hacking allows law enforcement to plant malicious code on someones computer in order to gain access to the photos messages and text before they were ever encrypted in the first place and after theyve been decrypted the nsahas an entire team of advanced hackers possibly as many as   camped out at fort meade rogers statements of course are not a full fledged endorsement of privacy nor can the nsa be expected to make it a priority even so his new stance denotes a growing awareness within the government that americans are not comfortable with the states grip on their data so spending time arguing about hey encryption is bad and we ought to do away with it thats a waste of time to me rogers said thursday so what weve got to ask ourselves is with that foundation whats the best way for us to deal with it and how do we meet those very legitimate concerns from multiple perspectives this article nsa director finally admits encryption is needed to protect publics privacy is free and open source you have permission to republish this article under acreative commons license with attribution to carey wedler and theantimediaorg anti media radio airs weeknights at  pm eastern pm pacific image credit wwwelbpressede if you spot a typo email editstheantimediaorg what a whole lot of rot are they discussing this on tax payer funded time as the article stated given that government agencies have the ability to circumvent encryption whats the point of their talks i have no doubt that the chip manufactures build in back doors i am electronically challenged but agree wholeheartedly most leos are using this for fishing expeditions to facilitate civil forfeiture aka highway robbery civilian hackers are having a heyday just got my new chipped credit cards and within a few weeks   out of   were hacked even though they never left my sight what a pi a  nsa supports encryption only because they can hack it at will fbi hates it only because they dont want to have to rely on nsa for it there is no privacy left in america

4,charles dean hood was sentenced to death in   by a texas judge who had been sleeping with the prosecutor in his case it took hood almost   years to establish that fact but he finally managed to force the two officials to testify about their rumored affair in the fall of   they admitted it texas highest court for criminal matters its court of criminal appeals considered all of this and concluded that hood should be executed anyway in a     decision in september the court told hood that he had taken too long to raise the issue of whether a love affair between a judge and a prosecutor amounted to a conflict of interest hood has asked the united states supreme court to hear his case on thursday   former judges and prosecutors filed a brief supporting him so did   experts in legal ethics a judge who has engaged in an intimate extramarital sexual relationship with the prosecutor trying a capital murder case before her has a conflict of interest and must recuse herself the brief from the ethics experts said of all the courts to have considered the issue only the texas court of criminal appeals in this case failed to recognize this imperative the affair itself as described in the depositions of the two former lovers sounded tawdry and sad judge verla sue holland who presided over hoods case in a district court in collin county texas testified that she and the prosecutor thomas s oconnell jr had had sex at each others homes when their spouses were away this happened she said seven or eight times oconnell did not seem especially romantic holland testified that he once gave her a picture of a polar bear with a matching cup another time he gave her a chafing dish he never stayed the night i had a truck that everybody recognized oconnell explained and he might have been more sympathetic when hollands mother died tom didnt send a card the judge testified he didnt send flowers he didnt come by he didnt call you know i think thats pretty callous asked if they had professed their love to each other holland sounded wistful yeah she said yes i loved him holland was elected to the court of criminal appeals in   served for five years and sat with eight of the nine judges who considered her conduct last september the exception was judge cathy cochran one of four women on the court and the author of the dissenting opinion cochran took a stab at characterizing the relationship in a footnote it was misleading cochran wrote to say that holland and oconnell had an intimate sexual relationship though she conceded that the phrase was literally true theirs was hardly the torrid relationship of romance novels cochran clarified it was rather a close personal relationship that on a few rare occasions dipped into intimacy whatever the precise contours and intensity of the affair holland did testify that she would have disqualified herself from hoods case had his lawyers asked but she also said she and oconnell had kept their extramarital affair secret she said it ended in   three years before hoods trial in her deposition holland said she had lately become angry with hoods lawyers for annihilating my reputation she said she had asked the attorney generals office to represent her in hoods challenge to her conduct because she thought she needed to fight back she was was tired of laying over she said and getting licked without any input hood was convicted of murdering a couple he had been living with ronald williamson and tracie lynn wallace in plano texas in   the district attorney in collin county john r roach has said that the case should not be reopened in light of the gravity of those crimes and hoods delay in pursuing rumors of the affair roach added that there was no need for a categorical rule against a little romance the existence of a prior sexual relationship between a judge and a prosecutor is not cause to absolutely disqualify a judge roach told the appeals court last year at some point the past romantic relationships of even public figures become a matter that is entitled to some privacy john r rolater jr a lawyer in roachs office declined to elaborate we have no comment at this time because of the pending litigation rolater said in an e mail message on friday the supreme court has lately taken some interest in the integrity of the judicial system last year it ruled that millions of dollars in campaign spending on behalf of a west virginia judge was reason enough to require his disqualification from a case involving his supporter the probability of actual bias on the part of the judge justice anthony m kennedy wrote for the majority was too high to be constitutionally tolerable and last month the supreme court ordered the federal appeals court in atlanta to have another look at a case in which jurors in a capital trial gave a trial judge an odd gift    a penis made of chocolate from beginning to end the unsigned majority decision said judicial proceedings conducted for the purpose of deciding whether a defendant shall be put to death must be conducted with dignity and respect to review the bidding campaign spending may undermine the integrity of the judicial system the same goes for a gag gift of confectionary genitalia but a love affair between the judge and prosecutor in a death penalty case is in texas at least another matter
3,war is a racket thank a veteran but dont feed onebrandon turbeville yet seldom do americans ask what service they are thanking these veterans for since most americans simply parrot the latest buzz terms without ever actually questioning them of course there are some for whom no amount of war and slaughter will ever be enough to vicariously make them feel like bigger men or a great nation most however are simply ignorant the truth is that the service for which veterans are being thanked has nothing to do with the freedom of the american people as the most decorated marine in american history at the time general smedley butler stated i served in all commissioned ranks from a second lieutenant to a major general and during that time i spent most of my time being a high class muscle man for big business for wall street and for the bankers in short i was a racketeer for capitalism butler discovered that he was a tool of the world oligarchy many others have since discovered the fact that they were nothing more than pawns albeit of a much lower level after their youth and health was spent in the process of slaughtering innocent people many soldiers from the world wars korea vietnam iraq and afghanistan have come to the same conclusion and no doubt a number of those who have participated in the attack on libya iraq and syria will do the same there is also no doubt that many of these soldiers signed up because they perceived their country to be under attack and that those people across the world were vicious enemies who wanted to see the american people destroyed while skewed and tragically ignorant many joined the ranks of the military for noble reasons unfortunately even the noblest of reasons does not make a lie the truth whatever ones reasons for joining the battle the end result is the same thousands to millions of human beings sons fathers mothers daughters grandmothers cousins wives husbands are killed in unimaginable ways because of the desires of international banks corporations and governments these people despite the cynical and vile propaganda designed to portray them as subhuman savages very much care about their families they love them every much as americans love theirs they love their homes and the land they grew up on their hearts are ripped out of their chests when they lay their   year old daughter in a shallow grave because big oil wanted a new pipeline they lose a part of themselves when their ailing grandmother is stabbed to death because their village is just one step toward higher profits for international banks these are the services our veterans are performing while americans are so far removed from reality that they foolishly attempt to suggest that what they saw on their television from the comfort of their homes on    somehow equates with the suffering that millions of iraqis have felt and continue to feel on a daily basis it doesnt so perhaps it would be wise to forgive iraqis for not tearing up whenever they hear the star spangled banner or standing at attention whenever they hear of a fallen hero from the united states unfortunately we shouldnt hold our breath that the general american public will realize anytime soon that smedley butler was right when he said that war is a racket to them american blood is different from all other blood because american blood is right american blood is always spilled to promote freedom and democracy american blood is civilized but what about that american blood when it comes home or i should say if it comes home if the veterans returning home can manage to keep their hair cut their boots clean and their delusional programming that taught them they fought for freedom and democracy then things may fall into place they can get jobs maybe and then be admitted into the circle of masturbation that constantly reminds the american people that these veterans served their country and thus demand respect for doing so they can be thanked for their service every time the word veteran is uttered in a public setting those who joined for the thrill and found war to be a pleasurable experience can then become police so they can continue to terrorize innocent civilians but this time do so closer to home but if their luck is not so fortunate if they lost their legs absorbed shrapnel or injured their brain then they will be forced into a future of disability and pain substandard treatment subsistence payments unemployment and despair talking about their wounds of course will keep americans entertained at first but only for so long the general public simply does not have the attention span to hear war stories that end in wheelchairs and blindness particularly if the story is told through stuttering lips and slurred speech after all john wayne and rambo never ended up in a wheelchair if of course they found war to be such a distasteful exercise that their own minds can no longer comprehend the experience and will no longer allow them to function in normal society they will face these obstacles and more not even the requisite thank you for your service will be uttered to these victims of american foreign policy theirs will be a life of arrest psychiatric services drug addiction and alcoholism like their unemployed counterparts mental victims of war will be relegated to homelessness where they walk through a new war zone where this time they are the helpless civilians but men in uniforms remain the real terrorists on the street the same people who sent them to war by their armchair support or by their apathy will look at them with disdain on their way to the local starbucks or football game after all john wayne never asked for a handout rambo never mumbled to himself they came home and got jobs they got told thank you for your service and they accepted it they never reminded us about the ugly truth of war that it is a racket and a boon for banks and corporations they never forced us to understand that the people we supported killing were more like us than we ever could have imagined john wayne and rambo were good veterans its just a shame they werent real after our wars in the past the bad veterans were always left behind to remind us of the after effects of a tragedy far away they reminded us that war is a two way street even if it is not perceived that way on the political front in   however we have had enough of being reminded it is time for the homeless and in particular homeless veterans to go away in cities all across the country homelessness is being criminalized the victims and reminders of the results of an imperialist war policy and free trade economics are being swept away from public view in cities throughout america feeding the homeless is now against the law punishable by fines and even jail the most basic expression of humanity kindness and compassion providing food is now considered a crime ironically these crimes are prosecuted in the same cities that will no doubt fund and organize veterans day parades americans however are not interested in the veterans on the streets of myrtle beach orlando or other cities across the country that enforce the rules demanding that they dont feed the animals for most americans rules are rules the signs say dont feed the animals so they wont instead they will thank them for their service and enjoy the parade

3,october surprise   shocking rumors that could change the outcome of the electionmichel snyder contributor americans tend to have very short attention spans so you wouldnt want to reveal your october surprise too early but now that the debates finished this is the perfect opportunity to bring the hammer down of course our founding fathers are probably rolling over in their graves as they watch all this but sadly the truth is that this is how the game of politics is played in america today veteran political operatives on both sides know that it is either eat or be eaten and this election is coming right down to the wire one nicely timed blow from either side could make all the difference even a false rumor could change the outcome of the election if enough people believe it and i certainly would not rule out the possibility of operatives on both sides floating false rumors in the coming days in an attempt to get an edge after the election the rumors may turn out to be entirely baseless but at that point nobody will be able to undo the results of the election most americans would be absolutely horrified to find out what goes on behind the scenes in political campaigns in this day and age a lot of political operatives will do literally anything to win of course an october surprise is even more effective if it is actually true and there certainly seems to be a lot of important things that the american people do not know about obama and romney yet did barack obama sell cocaine while he was in college according to radaronlinecom a close friend of barack obama during his college years is ready to come forward with allegations that obama sold cocaine while he was in college if this story is true it could potentially be absolutely huge but even if it comes out now we probably wont know whether it is true or not until after the election is mitt romney a major investor in the voting machine company that made the voting machines that will count the votes in ohio liberal websites are going crazy over a story that alleges that mitt romney and other members of his family are major investors in a voting machine company that made the voting machines that will count the votes in ohio on november  th needless to say the truth is still very alarming what will people say if the voting results in ohio are much more favorable for romney than anticipated radical islamists are regularly visiting the white house according to the investigative project on terrorism radical islamists have been regularly visiting the white house during the obama adminisration you can read the rest of the ipt report right here a spanish company will be counting many of our votes as i have reported previously a spanish company known as scytl will be involved in reporting election results for hundreds of jurisdictions across the united states on election day according to wnd there are serious concerns about the security of scytl software the state of florida has also found vulnerabilities in scytl software so will these vulnerabilities by exploited on november  th allegations of voter fraud on both sides as i wrote about the other day both the democrats and the republicans have already been accused of committing voter fraud down in florida voters are receiving letters in the mail questioning their citizenship and instructing them not to vote for much more on reports of voter fraud from all around the nation please see this article are operatives from both parties systematically committing election fraud threats of violence if romney wins over the past few weeks obama supporters have been flooding social media with threats that they will riot in the streets of our major cities if romney wins many have even been threatening direct physical violence against mitt romney himself if romney wins the election of course if these threats were being made against obama the mainstream media would be having an absolute field day with them but because they are being made against mitt romney they are being ignored to see some of the most disturbing threats against mitt romney on twitter please see this article but please be warned that some of the foul language used in these threats is extremely strong it is absolutely mind blowing that the mainstream media is ignoring these threats which continue to endlessly pour in every single day are they also going to ignore the rioting and violence that erupt once romney wins an october surprise from gloria allred radaronlinecom is reporting that gloria allred is heading to court in an attempt to dig up some dirt on mitt romney could gloria allred once again change the course of an election so what do you think about all these rumors do you have any to add to the list please feel free to post a

4,it is nesting season here and just offshore kemps ridley sea turtle no  circles in the water before dragging herself onto the sand to lay another clutch of eggs the sea turtle affectionately nicknamed thelma by a national park service employee has already beaten some terrible odds still in the egg she was airlifted here from mexico in the wake of the   blowout of the ixtoc   rig which spilled millions of gallons of oil into the gulf of mexico and covered the turtles primary nesting place now thelma and others of her species are being monitored closely by worried scientists as another major oil disaster threatens their habitat federal officials said on tuesday that since april     days after the accident on the deepwater horizon they have recorded   sea turtle deaths most of the turtles were kemps ridleys and though they cannot say for sure that the oil was responsible the number is far higher than usual for this time of year the officials said the deepwater horizon spill menaces a wide swath of marine life from dolphins to blue crabs on tuesday the national oceanic and atmospheric administration expanded a fishing ban in the gulf because of the spreading oil but of the endangered marine species that frequent gulf waters only the kemps ridley relies on the region as its sole breeding ground since the ixtoc   spill the turtles whose numbers fell to several hundred in the  s have made a fragile comeback and there are now at least    adults scientists say but the oil gushing from the deepwater horizon could change that more than any other large marine animals the turtles may be vulnerable to the oil spreading through the gulf an ancient creature driven by instinct it is programmed to forage for food along the coast from louisiana to florida in the path of the slick it lives its entire life cycle in the gulf which is why we are so critically concerned said dr patrick m burchfield a scientist at the gladys porter zoo in brownsville texas who has studied the kemps ridley for   years the nesting season for the sea turtles runs until mid july and for most of that time they will remain off padre island and the beaches of mexico where there is currently no oil but then things become more chancy as new sea turtle babies go off to sea floating on currents in the gulf or on seaweed patches that could be covered by crude hungry after egg laying adult females are known to go to the mouth of the mississippi a particularly rich feeding ground to replenish themselves andre m landry jr of the sea turtle and fisheries ecology research laboratory at texas am university galveston said that satellite radios have been attached to several sea turtles including thelma for research he hopes these will offer clues about what is happening offshore if she is beached it is going to be constantly sending out a signal as opposed to the random signals they send out when they randomly come up to breathe landry said barbara schroeder national turtle coordinator for noaa fisheries the government agency charged with assessing damage to offshore life said that the agency was investigating the sea turtle deaths intensively but did not have many answers yet she said that so far full necrospies had been performed on   turtles and partial necropsies on another   internal inspections of the animals she said did not reveal oil but she added that scientists still had to test tissue samples taken from some of the turtles for evidence of oil she cautioned that it might be hard to determine conclusively how the turtles died or even how the spill was affecting the species more generally people think this is like television where the mystery is solved in one hour she said it is very complex most of the impacts occurring to turtles are out of sight most turtles never wash ashore the kemps ridley is millions of years old its ancestors once swam with dinosaurs a sandy olive color kemps ridleys are the smallest of the sea turtles only about two feet across although the turtles have been sighted along the atlantic seaboard they must return to the warm waters of the gulf to breed as recently as the  s they were abundant in the mexican gulf waters tens of thousands at a time would come ashore on the same day at rancho nuevo a remote mexican beach in tamaulipas state to lay their eggs in the synchronized pattern unique to their breed but pollution the collection of eggs for food and aphrodisiacs and the nets of shrimp trawlers depleted their numbers then came the blowout on the ixtoc   the deepwater well dumped three million barrels of crude into the gulf covering the beach at rancho nuevo nine thousand hatchlings had to be airlifted to nearby beaches although the role of the oil in killing the turtles was never confirmed by   there were fewer than    kemps ridleys left and the international union for conservation of nature declared the species one of the   most endangered in the world to prevent a single environmental catastrophe from sending the turtles into extinction eggs from remaining turtles including an egg that became sea turtle no  were brought here to padre island to begin a new colony at birth the babies were set free in the surf down the road from the ranger station to allow them to imprint the beach on their memories then captured again and protected until they were   months old and less susceptible to becoming prey we called it head start after the school program said donna j shaver chief of sea turtle science and recovery for the national park service at padre island who has worked with the sea turtles there since   no  has returned to the island six times to lay clutches of eggs burying her most recent round of   eggs in the sand by an enormous rusted beached buoy only one and a half miles from where she was first put into the surf   years ago their precision is really amazing shaver said she and other scientists will be watching the radio blips from the tagged turtles closely but the tracking device is not infallible the transmitters might stop functioning because of dead batteries and even if a turtle is known to have beached the carcass might never be found or might be found only after serious decomposition and the cause of death might never be known still shaver prefers to think positively until more results come in when i got here there were many who thought the species might not survive at all she said weve come so far
4,insurance group seeks compatible suv car standards by david shepardson detroit news washington bureau washington   us motorists could save thousands of dollars in crash repairs if car and suv bumpers were more compatible according to a study released today by the insurance institute for highway safety testing by the group showed that even slow speed rear crashes   at   miles per hour   can cost    to    in repair bills the industry funded group that lobbies for auto safety improvements wants the national highway traffic safety administration to require bumpers on all light trucks and set new rules to make the vehicles more compatible suvs and cars share the road said joe nolan chief administrative officer for the nonprofit research group the problem is they dont share the same bumper rules and consumers end up paying the price federal rules require all cars to have bumpers that protect within a zone of   to   inches from the ground that means car bumpers better line up during crashes and help minimize damage but there are no bumper requirements for suvs minivans or pickups virtually all light pickup trucks however have bumpers automakers noted automakers oppose the institutes efforts to require new standards for bigger vehicles saying they would reduce the functionality and versatility of suvs and other light trucks the alliance of automobile manufacturers   which represents detroits big three toyota motor corp and eight other automakers   said lowering suv bumpers would not add any safety benefits a lower ground clearance could reduce the amount of payload light trucks could carry we can certainly understand the insurance industrys interest in managing their repair costs during tough economic times but this isnt a safety issue alliance spokesman wade newton said automakers have worked hard   with the iihs and others   to address safety related vehicle compatibility issues through our voluntary agreement to engineer vehicles so theyre more compatible in front and side impact crashes in   automakers voluntarily agreed to make cars and light trucks more compatible in front and side crashes over a six year period by last summer all vehicles complied with the voluntary standards this is the latest push by the insurance institute in july   the organization petitioned nhtsa to amend the existing bumper standard to require compliance by light trucks the agency sought public comment in the summer of   and is still considering the petition we are completing our analysis of those responses along with other data available to us and will announce our decision upon completion of our review nhtsa spokeswoman karen aldana said wednesday regulators have previously said requiring light trucks to have bumpers would compromise off road performance and make the vehicles hard to use at loading ramps the institute has argued that other features air dams bumper covers exhaust pipes and other trim mounted lower than the bumpers get in the way in such instances

4,premier wu den yih insisted friday that legislation that would overturn parts of a protocol on beef imports from united states will not affect arms sales to taiwan but a professor and a former diplomat said it would deal a serious blow to taiwans credibility the legislative yuan reached a consensus wednesday to pass an amendment to the act governing food sanitation on jan   that will ban imports of beef offal and ground beef from areas where cases of mad cow disease have been documented over the previous   years including the united states though the legislation contravenes the beef trade protocol taipei and washington signed in october and has drawn a stern rebuke from the us the premier dismissed speculation that it will adversely affect planned us weapons sales to taiwan under the taiwan relations act potential retaliation will not involve shelving arms sales to taiwan wu stressed taiwan plans to send a delegation to the us that was originally planned as an effort to mitigate the fallout from the legislation but the premier said friday the delegation will mainly observe rather than explain taiwans stance the delegation likely to be comprised of legislators and officials would mainly inspect slaughterhouses meat processing factories and packing procedures to better control the safety of us beef that will be exported to taiwan the premier said wu said he believes the us will understand that taiwans legislature does not always accept all of the decisions made by the executive branch without expressing any opinions but professor chen i hsin of tamkang universitys institute of american studies said friday that regardless of the delegations intentions washington which said it was deeply concerned and disappointed by the legislation would not be moved reneging on the protocol could trigger a spate of retaliatory moves by washington chen suggested including stalling visa free treatment for taiwanese tourists visiting the us shelving arms sales and cutting us support for taiwans participation in major international organizations he contended that an existing inspection regime known as the three controls and five certifications  is effective enough in keeping potentially hazardous beef parts from the u s out of the country making the potentially harmful legislative amendment redundant taiwan would have its credibility compromised by voting into law an amendment that would reverse the protocol he warned veteran diplomat eugene yi cheng lok also advised against passing the legal revision because taiwan will be accused of arbitrarily abrogating agreements except for stopping the passage of the amendment nothing will help change the situation not even sending a delegation to the us lok asserted
4,an older white bearded lawmaker sits at his desk in afghanistans wolsi jirga parliaments lower chamber telling others about a report detailing a us attack that left several civilians dead a stir goes up in the chamber as his voice rises we send this report to president karzai as well another minister of parliament this one with a salt and pepper beard takes up the discussion as others talk lean into each others desks joke laugh and mill about the chamber its the start of a daylong vote that is critical to the formation of president hamid karzais government after his re election only   years old afghanistans new political scene can bear a striking resemblance to congress and state legislatures in america saturdays proceedings could have been a day in the life of a us legislative body right down to the video cameras sharp debate and the photo that runs in the next days newspaper lawmakers of various ideologies form alliances cut deals and manage to get along with a collegial nature despite their differences after the days session opens the wolsi jirgas speaker mohammad younus qanooni makes a somber request on behalf of a member of parliament whose aunt has died raise your hands and pray for her he urges and many lawmakers do members of the assembly represent this texas size countrys   provinces and the colorful clothing worn here including the green and black striped chapan a winter coat worn by men from the north including karzai hint at afghanistans complex mosaic of tribal people back in florida you might detect the same diversity in the spanish accented voices of cubans high pitched intonations of transplanted new yorkers baritones of african americans and the southern drawls of tallahassee natives as they debate in the house and senate there are differences with us statehouses to be sure politicians here tend to have beards and wear turbans called lungi or the pakol a flat thin cap favored by the mujahedeen during their long war with the soviets members do not have push button voting systems built into their desks they wave red or green cards green is yes red is no the atmosphere is informal lawmakers sit in maroon theater seats behind long wooden desks the parliament building itself looks run down inside and out those entering the grounds work their way through a maze of tight security men armed with kalashnikov rifles are everywhere still the elected leaders of this country conduct themselves with a certain grace or it just might be good old fashioned sucking up an mp representing a nomadic tribe compliments speaker qanooni for bringing order to a tough process thank you very much because you are organizing the session very well he said i have never seen organizers like you laughter fills the room as in us national politics women are greatly outnumbered by men and those in the wolsi jirga dress far more conservatively wearing headscarves that cover their necks ears and most of their hair on this day one who dares to let her scarf down is chastised by a fellow lawmaker a man who raises his red card to object the constitution of the islamic republic of afghanistan requires women to cover their heads if it is contrary to american notions of freedom its nothing new to afghans the wolsi jirga and mishrano jirga or upper house are a fragile experiment in representative government and saturdays session is a bigger deal than most lawmakers are voting to confirm   members of karzais cabinet and it is a contentious complex affair the vote is done in secret each member marking off a set of thick yellow papers behind a tall partition that looks like a confessional after voting they place the documents into one of two plastic tubs like their legislative counterparts in the us the government in kabul is bitterly divided and this vote will underscore the point when it ends the wolsi jirga will have rejected   candidates this is a very historic day in parliament fawzia koofi a one time karzai supporter and one of the nations most prominent female mps said outside the chamber which was built during the late  s we need to stand by our nation because the expectation of the afghan people is that this is not a cabinet thats going to address the peoples issues    security corruption and poverty koofi added the secrecy in this vote irritates some including afghanistans former planning minister ramazan bashardost who came in third during last years presidential election if you are honest that vote shouldnt be secret if you want the nation to know about it it should be open he said another mp shokria barikzai agreed we have to show the people we are representing they should know when we are voting barikzai declared qanooni chimed in in the constitution they didnt mention that it should be secret they just said vote many similar exchanges follow as voting on the cabinet takes up a long afternoon but theres also a sense of camaraderie and humor in this divided house bashardost widely admired by people on the street is an iconoclast when called to vote he uses the moment to stand before the assembly and raise the issue of members of parliament holding more than one passport its not the first time bashardost has brought up the matter and it wont be the last the dual nationality issue hasnt been resolved perhaps a third of the lawmakers have left for lunch but the decibel

4,money talks otherwise why were the yankees with baseballs highest payroll of some   million holding such a commanding lead over the angels with their payroll of a mere   million the doomsday scenario is reasserting itself with a vengeance in the american league and maybe in all of baseball oh my goodness what if the yankees with all of that cable money actually make the right decisions the yankees were up three games to one going into game   of the al championship series on thursday evening and anything was still possible of course the angels are a very good team and not cheaply constructed either but the yankees have stockpiled monsters like alex rodriguez cc sabathia and mark teixeira to go along with family treasures like derek jeter mariano rivera jorge posada and andy pettitte its like every day youre looking somebody to your right or left and saying do you believe this guy i mean have you seen a guy like this guy thats a handful of guys on this team raved aj burnett the not inexpensive pitcher who was trying to close out the angels on thursday night money has been screaming in the postseason what with the phillies having sunk almost   million into the ryan howards of the world while the dodgers at a mere   million settled for chubby manny ramirez who loves showers hes a nice old man isnt he hes very clean that series ended fast four out of five wednesday night in baseballs version of college basketballs final four there have been no charming outsiders this time around true four of the six highest payrolls did not make it to the final four including the mets with their second highest payroll of   million im not quite sure the mets fielded a team this season i will have to go back over my notes maybe baseball got lucky in the past decade with fresh faces like the diamondbacks the angels the marlins the red sox the white sox the tigers the cardinals the rockies the rays and the phillies all getting to the world series but as of thursday baseball was in the shadow of a rod and his mates playing up to their potential which is to say playing impressively maybe to some fans it was downright frightening demoralizing rodriguez batted   with three homers and five runs batted in in the first four games and virtually all of his output came in important settings and that was only part of it his heightened energy levels physical and mental are obvious to anyone in the way he runs the bases and plays third base and even in how he rushed to guard home when posada had momentary brain lock and left it unguarded one of the great players in the sport has been having the october of his life one could say this is why the yankees hired him but it was not just a rod one could make the case that the yankees possess at least five players    rodriguez sabathia teixeira jeter and rivera    who are better than the best angel lets say torii hunter a terrific center fielder and a glowing presence who has the highest salary on the angels at   million for five years or maybe you could throw in burnett and posada    and while youre at it hideki matsui robinson cano and johnny damon asked if it was almost unfair that the yankees have accumulated such a team burnett said no i cant say that because its the big leagues everybodys good speaking of the yankees burnett continued but everybodys a future hall of famer it seems like jeters always in the right spot hes always making his plays defensively alex doing what he does and cc doing what he does its just been that way all year its been something new all year its been the whole team it never stops there was still time for it to stop or be stopped but just exactly who was going to do that the spreadsheet from major league baseball payrolls collated by the web site cots baseball contracts demonstrates the huge gap between the haves and the have nots the yankees have been looking like a powerhouse since midseason when it was clear that sabathia was the ace the team has not had since who ron guidry teixeira just might be the same kind of teammate and all around player as don mattingly    with power wow teixeira was slumping at   for   going into thursdays game yet he was shutting down the angels with his nifty glove and feet asked if he felt grateful at managing a collection like this manager joe girardi said quite touchingly that he was also blessed with a good family and a good life then he added oh i think youre fortunate that you have an ownership group in the steinbrenner family that puts together a club like this every year they do whatever they can they take what they earn from the club and put it in the payroll for much of this decade the ever shifting yankees front office could not quite get it right with expensive infusions of jason giambi kevin brown and randy johnson they had the money things just went wrong this year the yankees are either awesome or scary depending on your point of view as burnett was suggesting whats fair got to do with it

violence erupted between protesters and a team of security officers hired by the company behind the project local media reports unquestioningly repeated statements from the morton county sheriffs office which claimed that the violence was initiated by the protesters thedapl alternatively known as the bakken pipelineis owned by dallas texas based corporation energy transfer partners lp which created the subsidiary dakota access llc the pipelinewill stretch    miles upon completion and transport crude oil from the bakken fields of north dakota to patoka illinoisthe projectis set to cross the missouri river not far from the standing rock sioux reservation in north dakota the sacred stone and red warrior camps were formed in opposition to the dapl around    on saturday afternoon an estimated two to three hundred supporters from the red warrior camp marched to the construction site the marchers climbed over a fence to get closer to the site as they neared the site the scene became violent onceprotestersarrived at the construction area they broke down a wire fence by stepping and jumping on itthe sheriffs office said according to numerous witnesses within five minutes the crowd ofprotesters estimated to be a few hundred people became violent they stampeded into the constructionarea with horses dogs and vehiclesmorton county sheriff kyle kirchmeier said it was more like a riot than a protest the morton county sheriffs office saidfour private security guards and two guard dogs were injured in the meleewhile reports of horses and a few hundred people were true the originof the violence is unclear videos of the incident clearly show protesters using flag poles to defend against theattack dogs being wielded by security officers there are currently no known videos showing knives being used by protesters however there are videos showing protesters with wounds from the dogs and pepper spray being used indiscriminately against the crowd for a powerful look at the violence see the report below from democracy now the standing rock sioux tribereportedthat six people had been bitten by security dogsand atleast   people were pepper sprayedvicki granado a spokeswoman for energy transfer partners told cbs the protesters attacked the workers the protesters were eventually successful in driving off the security officers and halting construction however

rock sioux filed an emergency motion in court on sunday seeking a temporary restraining order seeking to prevent destruction sacred sites which are threatened by thedakota access pipeline on saturday dakota access pipeline and energy transfer partners brazenly used bulldozers to destroy our burial sites prayer sites and culturally significant artifacts archambault said in a statement they did this on a holiday weekend one day after we filed court papers identifying these sacred sites the desecration of these ancient places has already caused the standing rock sioux irreparable harm were asking the court to halt this path of destruction thestanding rock sioux believes they were not properly consulted before the us army corps of engineers approvedthe pipeline project a us district court in washington dc is expected to rule by september   on whether the army corps of engineers violated the law destroying the tribes sacred places over a holiday weekend while the judge is considering whether to block the pipeline shows a flagrant disregard for the legal process said jan hasselman attorney for the standing rock sioux the tribe has been seeking to vindicate its rights peacefully through the courts but dakota access pipeline used evidence submitted to the court as their roadmap for what to bulldoze thats just wrong one of the most disturbing aspects of this weekendis the outright lies and bias from the deadstream formerly known as the mainstream media while social media pages were filled with videos showing the protesters or protectors as they prefer being pepper sprayed and attacked it would be hours and days before the local media corrected the reports to admit that the security officers were violent following the incident kxnews in north dakotareported once inside pipeline security officers were hit and jabbed with fence posts and flag poles knives were also reportedly pulled out by the end of the weekend the story had been updated to reflect the violence used by the security officers authorities and protesters have both reported tactics including assault tear gas release and use of attack dogs its not confirmed if dakota access used tear gas or attack dogs on protesters but many people their say thats what they saw i wasnt expecting them to mace it came out of now where they let the dogs loose on a horse and they maced a woman in the face this close range thats what started it all say protesters this event should serve as an importantreminder of how criticaldefeating the media is in order to create a more free and ethical worldwhen you sit back and analyze the problems of our world you begin to recognize that the culprit behind the turmoil is not simply a corrupt president or judges or even corruption in local police departments the infection runs deep in this system one of the most crucial aspects of this fight is the control and influence exerted by the corporate media without the corporately controlled state friendly narrative being pushed on billions of television and computer screens the masses would recognize the truth of our situation without the deadstream media pundits who would teach us to be divided and ignorant take solace in the fact that every time the deadstream media attempts to selllies and keep us divided the independent people driven media is there to tell the truth and to expose the lies take heart

stand your ground im proud that all native people comes together and fight for justice since europeans arrived in n america   m indigenous the rothschild corporate bankster empire needs that oil gas why should native americans be treated any different than iraqis by zio hirelings and mercenaries that have disappeared because they are an inferior culture they continue to prove that inconvenient truth no they arent an inferior culture it isnt the indigenous people who are murdering our earth its the greedy rich white people who are destroying earth and all her inhabitants native americans are intelligent enough to realize that if we destroy our planet in search of yet more oil instead of free energy we kill our home and earth will no longer support life this might seem like a simple thing to understand but too many white people with  simply dont get it so whos the one with an inferior culture again why the shouting i knowim part of the indigenous people of norway and i support the first nations struggle notice to the red terrorists  western civilization has declared you obsolete speaking of garbage take a look into yourself and describe what you see you seem to be a human being

system and i suggest that those rioters stop their foolishness and join the usa system their sacred site aka ancient garbage dump is now owned by whoever is putting in a pipeline and they should be grateful that some economic activity is taking place maybe they should be applying for a job helping to put in the pipeline instead of being part of a group of troublemakers bill moore scenes like this are playing into their hands the people are duped and dont know it i like the term deadstream media compared to the old passive mainstream media and the dakota access protest movement as this article states has to insure that some alternative and honest media is available to counter the deadstream media however it is even more important in broadening the awareness and truth of the overall conflict that the media should really be understood as being only one sector   the mediapropaganda sector of the overall disguised global capitalist empire this disgusied global capitalist empire has now captured controlled and nearly fully occupies our former country which the empire uses and abuses as its nominal global hq and merely poses as the country pka previously known as america there is no more country of america or the united states of america nor the republic for which it stands nor certainly a functioning democracy nor certainly the essential nation unless the essential nation is defined as a perfect hiding place for the metropole of the disguised capitalist global empire and the mediapropaganda sector of the empire is only one of the empires seven highly integrated but well hidden sectors of corporate financial militarist media propaganda extra legal cfr wall streets think tank and this dual party vichy political facade of faux democracy behind both the tougher talking neocon r vichy party and the smoother lying neoliberal con d vichy party both of which are totally controlled this has been developed intellectually and in practice as part of a council of foreign

destruction and the mass violence of war and conquest the structures of domination have largely been hidden the solidarity mechanisms of working class people have been undermined and debate about alternatives has been limited omitting the fact that a different socioeconomic project one worthy of humanitys best thoughts and feelings is possible the neoliberal geopolitical world is presented as

3,the formula of war vs a pandemic of freedomby jon rappoport follow the bouncing ball all the way to the end which is a beginning making war makes money winning a war makes more money the desire to keep making war requires building up and maintaining a standing army when many nations are pursuing this general course the threat need for maintaining a standing army rises to a new level the need for the sake of defense and preparedness to strengthen armies is exactly what war makers exploit dismantling this whole operation by scaling back foreign military bases withdrawing troops and setting boundaries and no go zones is anathema to war makers if jfk as a few scholars suggest was planning to get out of vietnam and if he was also in the process of planning space missions with russia these would have been ample reasons for his assassination everyone has his favorite reason for jfks murderhe wanted to take money creation out of the hands of the federal reserve he was about to blow the whistle on ufo secrets he was on the verge of destroying the cia he signed the   nuclear test ban treaty with russia he and his brother were trying to destroy the mafia jfk was about to lay taxes on multi billion dollar liberian shipping operations anti castro cubans hated him because he failed to back the bay of pigs invasion he was determined to push forward an ocean turbine technology for the generation of electricity everyone who has a reason for jfks murder is quite sure it is the primary or only reason if withdrawal from vietnam was one reason it speaks to the sensitivity of the war machine and its allied industries if international peace broke out what would happen to the us economy to be more precise what would happen to those corporations who depend on the largest government military contracts to be even more precise what would happen to these corporations who depend on government taxes and money invented out of thin air by elite government backed banks those corporations would imagine new enterprises or crash and the nation would have to find another way to have an economy would this signal beyond the chaos the end of the world no along a similar front if gangs were wiped out along with drug cartels and if the main terrorist groups were isolated attacked and defunded cut off from drug money diverted government tax money and elite invented money other sectors of the economy would take a hit but again the world would not end along a similar front if corporations who manufacture and sell poison eg drug companies pesticide companies were punished to the full extent of the law and even disbanded the economy would take another hit but again the world would not end along a similar front if cheating lying and thieving banks and allied wall st firms were punished to the full extent of the law and even disbanded the world would not end what would the new emerging economy look like that would depend on the imagination and challenging work done by individuals not governments who see new possibilities that would depend on people who attempt to wake up a population muddled in passive acceptance of whatever consumer products are shoved down their throats yes i know all this speculation sounds like dreaming impossible dreams but while im at it here is another one what would happen if everything ive written so far in this article became the subject of reasoned debate in colleges im talking about serious lengthy debate about a new economy several things would happen first it would come to light that the overwhelming number of students are intellectually incapable of carrying on such a dialogue that in itself would rank as an inconvenient truth students dont learn how to think in a rational fashion they know next to nothing about logic most of them arent even aware of what a line of reasoning looks like they cant follow such a line second it would become obvious that the overwhelming number of students are incapable of conceiving a new economy that is not spearheaded and controlled by government students are brainwashed into thinking that all significant change must come from above it must be planned it must be designed to produce some vague outcome called equality this preference for central government control and planning is sustained even though with a little thought its clear that government has been the driving and permissive criminal force that protects the very economy that is causing all the trouble third it would become obvious that the faculties of colleges are also intellectually incapable of carrying on this debate they too have been trained to ignore logic theyve also been trained to push a values laden agenda that celebrates centrally planned collectivist economies fourth the idea that free and independent and creative individuals could spearhead a new economy seems outrageous preposterous and even illegal to the mass of students and professors for them all non group associated individuals viewed in any light are a priori greedy criminals so actually this article isnt about creating a new economy its about the barriers to a rational extensive lengthy dialogue and debate about the creation of a new economy a dialogue by the way that goes beyond what might be contained in cell phone texting or tweeting how shocking here is just one idea that might spring up in the kind of dialogue im talking about urban farms they already exist of course in each case they began as an idea in the mind of one individual they didnt spring to life originally when six people walking down the street suddenly turned to each other and said urban farms these are very large operations that grow food crops for residents of cities especially those who cant afford good food the people themselves learn to grow the crops what would happen what would be the consequence of say    urban farms across america what would this do for the health and morale of people in cities how would profit be made and peripherally why is it that local state and federal government havent backed such an ideafor an infinitesimal fraction of the money they spend on alleviating poverty money that by the way seems to make things worse again peripherally what would happen if thousands of college students who matriculate on privileged campuses and yap endlessly about their lack of privilege instead turned their victimhood energies to starting urban farms and working in them would the world end would the sky fall the same questions could be asked about the students professors many of whom are merely paid propagandists of the state there are all sorts of interesting questions that could arise in a real debatedialogue heres another one what would a world without monsanto or merck actually look like or what would america look like with an army dedicated only to defense of the nation such a dialogue could lead to action many separate actions what a thought would the world end would the sky fall you want more pay particular and close attention to this one what would happen if one state in the union decided that anyone could offer health advice and non harmful non toxic treatment to another person for any ailment or illness without control from above without the need for government licensing suppose this arrangement between consenting adults was done by contract not license suppose both parties asserted that no liability or blame would be attached to the outcome of such advice or treatment in other words god forbid the citizens would actually take responsibility for themselves do you think many citizens and practitioners might flock to such a state do you think an economic bonanza might explode in that state do you think the outbreak of freedom might raise the morale in that area do you think improved health might result do you think other states might follow suit merely by removing at no cost their grotesque rules and licensingenforcement bureaus would you be afraid of such an arrangement understanding the fact that current orthodox medicine as licensed and practiced throughout the land results in widespread pharmaceutical devastation shown a projection of the foreseeable economic bonanza from the new arrangement i just outlined do you think there is at least one state in the us that might throw irrational caution to the winds and enact this program of health freedom in the kind of extended dialogue im talking about here individuals come up with lots of interesting ideasideas that could very well lead to action and in the process the nightmare zombie cloud of government control and meddling takes major hits all its operations aimed at interfering with freedom are exposed the crud washes off the unconscionable dreck drains away people start actually thinking again they start imagining again they feel their chains slipping away they come out of the collective dream they experience cascades of new energy they think about entrepreneurship in a new way they think about morality and ethics in a new way they re find themselves does the sky fall does the world end no it begins perhaps miracle of miracles the quantity of self invented victims begins to diminish perhaps untold numbers of people floating along in a new age daze because they see no way out of the dilemmas and conflicts of our time rise up from their plastic lotus pads sensing a genuine impulse of hope and desire for the first time in many years their own hope their own desire perhaps millions of people trapped in dead end robotic work feel a creak in the psychological and spiritual machinery that surrounds them as it begins to malfunction and split apart perhaps moon blown full bore doctrinal collectivist freaks feel a few pin pricks in the purple bloated corpse of their one size fits all planetary vision who knows what might happen if a true ongoing dialogue about a new economy persisted long enough if a person is dead inside and doesnt want to be dead inside he has to ask himself paraphrasing clint eastwood this question did he fire six shots into his psyche or only five if only five can he fire that last bullet into the passive trance that keeps him in thrall to control central waking up may be hard to do but its also contagious if a college dared to offer a four year course which consisted entirely of the dialoguedebate im proposing carried out along respectful lines omitting and barring the screaming opponents of free speech who knows what might happen as william blake wrote if the fool would persist in his folly he would become wise as the dialogue proceeds all sorts of foolish ideas would come to light and unravel and turn into other ideas and those ideas would transmute into useful ideas out of which would be born a few brilliant ideasand on it would go and the process itself would act as a catalyst for every person within listening range his own imagination would rev up he would discover his own future path would that be a calamity would the sky fall would the world end or would the dawn finally break its instructive to read what authors wrote about core values a hundred or two hundred years ago because then you can appreciate what has happened to the culture of a nation you can grasp the enormous influence of planned propaganda which changes minds builds new consensus and exiles certain disruptive thinkers to the margins of society you can see what has been painted over with great intent in order to promote tyranny that proclaims a greater good for all here are several statements about the individual written in  th century america the authors ralph waldo emerson henry david thoreau and james fenimore cooper were prominent figures emerson in his time was the most famous all greatness of character is dependent on individuality the man who has no other existence than that which he partakes in common with all around him will never have any other than an existence of mediocrity james fenimore cooper the less government we have the better the fewer laws and the less confided power the antidote to this abuse of by formal government is the influence of private character the growth of the individual ralph waldo emerson the former generations acted under the belief that a shining social prosperity was the beatitude of man and sacrificed uniformly the citizen to the state the modern mind believed that the nation existed for the individual for the guardianship and education of every man this idea roughly written in revolutions and national movements in the mind of the philosopher had far more precision the individual is the world ralph waldo emerson if a man does not keep pace with his companions perhaps it is because he hears a different drummer let him step to the music which he hears however measured or far away henry david thoreau they conformists think society wiser than their soul and know not that one soul and their soul is wiser than the whole worldsociety everywhere is in conspiracy against the manhood of every one of its memberswhoso would be a man must be a nonconformist nothing is at last sacred but the integrity of your own mind ralph waldo emerson can you imagine today any of these statements gaining traction in the public mind much less the mainstream media in the public mind yes i can the world as it is presented to us is a shrunken mural in which the individual must carve down his energies in order to fit in if he reverses that process he finds a new world that didnt seem to be there before but now it is it most

3,after legalizing medical marijuana puerto rico bans smoking itby john vibes while it is true that ingesting cannabis orally is far more healthy than smoking it people should have the free choice to decide what they want to do with their own body whether they have a prescription or not smoking marijuana is not being contemplated as part of a medical treatment justice secretary cesar miranda told the associated press this week however many drug rights activists have pointed out that this is an oppressive policy a lot of patients prefer to inhale the cannabis than take it orally if they have to take it only through a pill it can be very difficult to tell what the right dose is its pretty short sighted to take away that method that most patients rely on to figure out how cannabis affects them amanda reiman of the drug policy alliance said this recent policy in puerto rico shows just how ridiculous politicians are getting when it comes to the legalization of marijuana they are attempting to do everything they can to keep as many regulations on the plant as possible so they can continue to make money on legal penalties even todays supposedly legal drugs like alcohol and tobacco are still under regulations so strict that they are not far from being prohibited either john vibes writes for theantimediaorg where this first appeared follow on facebook and twitter to receive their latest articles

2,ikea bows down to shariah law in this disgusting way ikea is facing some serious backlash after making the controversial decision to eliminate women from the saudi edition of their catalog the international store actually photoshopped women out of their ads in order to comply with the restrictive guidelines in saudi arabia where any inch of flesh shown by a woman is considered a sin rather than complying with local religious dress codes ikea decided women were better off literally out of the picture after receiving media backlash ikea is at risk of losing some of their customers the superstore claims that they regret their decision but the damage may have already been done what do you think of ikeas decision to remove women from their catalog should they have stood up to the oppression of women in saudi arabia or just refused to distribute their catalog altogether
3,supreme court will not hear case about native american prisonersby derrick broze the supreme court will not hear an appeal of a lower courts decision to force native american inmates to cut their hair while in alabama prisons native inmates have argued that keeping their hair long is part of their spiritual traditions although many other prison systems allow inmates to follow the follow the grooming practices of their religion the  th us circuit court of appeals ruled that alabamas system could make its own assessment on the benefits and risks in august   the  th us circuit court of appeals upheld alabamas prison policy the associated press reported inmates had told the court that their long hair has deep religious significance and they wanted to keep their hair unshorn because of their beliefs their sacred and ancestral core religious traditions are at stake the inmates attorney mark sabel of montgomery previously told ap the department had argued that long hair was a hygiene risk and could be used to conceal weapons and contraband unfortunately denying the native community the right to grow long hair is not a new tactic this was one of the first actions taken across the country when natives were being forcibly assimilated native children were taken from their families and forced into boarding schools where they were given american names forced to cut their hair short and forbidden from speaking their own language read more on the boarding schools here the treatment varied from nation to nation and was worse for some communities than others but without a doubt the trend was towards mental physical and sexual abuse as well as outright denial of connection to their own families and history as a powerful people this action of cutting their hair was about breaking them down as a people and erasing the identities of the native communities in   william atkinson jones commissioner of indian affairs sent a letter to superintendents of all federal reservations and agencies ordering them to cut the hair of all natives jones wrote that long hair was not in keeping with the advancement they were making or would be expected to make in civilization he went on to lament that natives who returned to home on the reservation adopted all the old habits and customs which his education in our industrial schools has tried to eradicate the letter known as the haircut order also suggested that the officials could withhold food to force compliance to the order the saddest part of this story is that it involves two forms of oppression used by the state a corrupt prison industrial complex and suppression or outright destruction of the customs of the oppressed the mistreatment of native prisoners is also only one of many situations where indigenous populations are abused andor neglected selfnews post recently reported on an action where   activists marched from independence bridge on the texas mexico border to the front of the dos republicas coal mine to protest the theft and destruction of native lands and sacred sites the attacks on native communities extend well beyond the borders of the united states despite the constant attacks on native traditions lands and life itself many communities are actively resisting colonization whether its indigenous women in argentina resisting fracking or the spara people willing to die to defend the ecuadorian rainforest native peoples are not going quietly they are setting a powerful example for the rest of the world they are showing us what communities may have to do when pushed to the breaking point only by educating ourselves on the crimes against all peoples can we form alliances of empowered individuals leading empowered communities in an active resistance to the colonization of our minds and physical worlds we can and must create a more free just and moral world derrick broze is an investigative journalist and liberty activist he is the lead investigative reporter for selfnewspostcom and the founder of the theconsciousresistancecom follow him on twitter derrick is available for interviews this article may be freely reposted in part or in full with author attribution and source link the most important fact here was not said  long hair  individual power  its about control and breaking the spirit doesnt the supreme court have other more impotent things to do bad enough we lock people in cages let them at least have individuality so basically if you dont belong to a death cult that burns people at the stake for offending the pope or having the wrong religion no religious freedom for you what is the problem with letting the native indians grown their hair long dont they allow muslims to grown beards and wear turbans how about the sikh who cant cut their hair due to religious practices perhaps they want to keep the native americans in their place i am being blocked from posting this article to my twitter account ok they just accepted my post doodadoodaaaa
2,breaking north korea threatens to nuke white house see how obama responds north korea has long been accusing the united states of escalating military tensions in the korean peninsula and they have not been quiet about it now it appears that they have actually issued a threat to strike the pentagon and the white house with a nuclear weapon according to reports hwang pyong so the director of the general political bureau made the following statement during an address on tv if the us imperialists threaten our sovereignty and survivalour troops will fire our nuclear armed rockets at the white house and pentagonthe sources of all evil although this is not the first time north korea has threatened the united states it is disconcerting nonetheless many experts believe that north korea is still some time away from actually developing a nuclear weapon of their own what do you think of the threat
1,the wicked social control experiment using virus as the pretext for further enslavement is performing magnificently by implanting a sense of helplessness dependence and blind conformism it should be noted that the favorable atmosphere enabling them whoever they are to accomplish just that was contrived by the controlled and unscrupulous media in under a month of intense coordinated global brainwashing praise is in order not for the obviously immoral master plan but for the technical excellence of its execution in the subservient balkans local quislings have expectedly introduced a practically region wide state of emergency giving that ignoble set of local petty tyrants broad powers to impose controls and reorder the pattern of everyday life hardly noticed by anyone the operation has closely followed the choreography set by germanys infamous ermchtigungsgesetz of   the immediate pretext being the only major substantive difference between them similar restrictions and intrusions have been enjoined in all the leading western democracies as well  the background of the induced panic has been dealt with cogently and extensively by prof igor panarin here and here an indirect corroboration for prof panarins hypotheses as he modestly likes to call them is the official redesignation of the heretofore bland sounding covid   as the chinese virus personalizing at last the malignant invisible enemy german physician dr wolfgang wodarg has argued that corona has been known for decades to be an integral part of the viral structures attacking our bodies on an annual basis to which the human immune system has by and large successfully adapted  it seems that the enemys sudden onslaught was anything but unanticipated however curiously evidence has just emerged that a few months before the viral outbreak that is shaking the world on october     an interesting gathering was hosted in new york city by johns hopkins center for health security bloomberg school of public health world economic forum and the bill and melinda gates foundation it was organized under the code like name of event   the gathering received scant media attention and the remarkable prescience of its participants was left completely and unjustly unremarked to add another curious detail to these proceedings one of the key players bill gates turns out to be a known champion of a radical population control and here   and b mass vaccination without casting any aspersions it just so happens that in practical terms the two issues are closely entwined mass vaccinations preferably starting with the forced vaccination of very young children with substances of unknown but suspicious provenance and composition may be but a step in the population control program whether by directly injecting debilitating conditions and diseases or provoking sterility which ultimately comes down to the same thing  indeed the biggest known unknown as once someone famously put it of the coronavirus affair may be precisely the nature of the vaccine which will probably be generated by the same pharmaceutical establishments which so presciently foretold the onset of the current crisis since the crisis was elevated to a global level it is not beyond belief that the remedy will also be imposed globally the reputedly high infectiousness of this sinister chinese virus may be a perfect excuse for doing away with inconveniences like choice and suchlike niceties once it is decreed that everyone is required to submit meekly to the injection of the opaque substance billed as just in the nick of time solution for the distressed world  which brings us to another curiosity striking the alert observer whose television set of course is permanently turned off or if it is switched on it is for nothing more prosaic than to watch cooking shows forget high government officials who have dropped dead in the sanctioned and embargoed middle eastern country which bears the brunt of the public animosity of the western world they deserve it naturally because they hate our freedoms but one is hard put to explain never mind justify the virus apparent easy access to many high profile western figures many of them conspicuous in public life or the world of entertainment their susceptibility guarantees the wide dissemination of the message that covid   is no respecter of persons and that if it happened to them you may be next to mention just a few of these luminaries testing positive so far have been the game of thrones actor kristofer hivju hollywood star idris elba and the rightfully famous tom hanks and his wife rita wilson not to mention sports figures such as kevin durant or even former nato secretary general javier solana whose misfortune is unlikely to encounter any sympathy in serbia why are these high profile infections curious because these are people who do not walk the crowded streets or use public transport typically they glide around in their limousines how did they get infected or were they perhaps exemplarily and discreetly infected precisely in order to maintain the believers in official facts in a hysteric state and to drive home the point that the day of reckoning is indeed nigh  we still can only speculate about much to do with this vicious plague but all is not darkness as we learn from this sermon by a wonderful american orthodox priest father josiah trenham virus chaos and christian fearlessness it could not have been said better

3,what is going to happen if interest rates continue to rise rapidlymichael snyder the higher interest rates go the more economic activity will be squeezed if interest rates continue to rise rapidly it will be more expensive for the us government to borrow money it will be more expensive for state and local governments to borrow money the housing market may crash again consumer debt will become more expensive junk bond investors will be in for a world of hurt the stock market will experience a tremendous amount of pain and there is a good chance that we could see the   trillion dollar interest rate derivatives bubble implode and that is just for starters so yes we all need to be carefully watching the yield on   year us treasuries on friday it opened at    and hit a high of    before closing at    the yield on   year us treasuries is up nearly   basis points since the beginning of may and almost everyone on wall street seems convinced that it is going to go much higher we are truly moving into unprecedented territory because we have been in a bull market for us treasuries for the last   years many investors dont even know that it is possible to lose money on us treasuries they have been described as risk free investments but that is far from the truth in fact we could see bond investors of all types end up losing trillions of dollars before it is all said and done and as i wrote about the other day we have just witnessed the largest cluster of hindenburg omens that we have seen since before the last financial crisis the stock market already seems ripe for a huge adjustment and rising interest rates could give it a huge extra push in a negative direction by the time it is all said and done stock market investors could end up losing trillions of dollars in the next stock market crash in addition rising interest rates could easily precipitate another housing crash asthe wall street journal discussed on friday as the yield on   year us treasuries goes up it will also cause mortgage rates to rise higher yields will push up long term borrowing cost for us consumers and businesses mortgage rates will rise and investors are keeping a close eye on whether this may derail the recovery of the housing market which has shown signs of turning a corner this year in one of my previous articles i included an example that shows just how powerful rising mortgage rates can be a year ago the   year rate was sitting at    percent the monthly payment on a   year    mortgage at that rate would be    if the   year rate rises to   percent the monthly payment on a   year    mortgage at that rate would be    does   percent sound crazy to you it shouldnt   percent was considered to be normal back in the year   if you own a    house today do you think it will be easier to sell it or harder to sell it if mortgage rates skyrocket yes of course it will be much harder in fact there is a good chance that you will have to reduce your selling price significantly so that prospective buyers can afford the payments let us hope that the yield on   year us treasuries levels off for a while if it says at this current level the damage will probably not be too bad but if it crosses the   percent mark and keeps soaring things could get messy pretty quickly in fact according to a bank of america merrill lynch investor survey the    percent mark is when the collapse of the bond market is likely to become disorderly our latest credit investor survey conducted july     showed that    on the   year is most commonly thought of as the trigger of a disorderly rotation ie higher interest rates leading to outflows and wider credit spreads among high grade investors put differently    on the   year will not lead to overall wider credit spreads if there is enough buying interest from institutional investors though note that the  s s spread curve would flatten further as mutual fundetf holdings are concentrated in the belly of the curve whereas institutional demand is disproportional in the long end of the curve however if the probability of a further move higher in interest rates to    is high which will be the perception if interest rate volatility is high certain institutional investors will choose to remain on the sidelines thus there may not be enough institutional buying interest to mitigate retail fund outflows and contain overall high grade spread levels so what is causing this well there are a number of factors of course but one very disturbing sign is that foreignersare selling off us treasuries at a pace that we have not seen since   one of the biggest fears in the financial markets is that foreign investors will stop buying us treasury securities causing borrowing rates to surge not that this is the beginning of a frightening trend but new data from the treasury department shows that foreigners were net sellers in june in fact this is the largest net sale of us securities since august   do you remember all of the warnings that we have received over the years about what would take place when foreign countries started dumping us debt well it looks like it may be starting to happen unfortunately there is no way that the party that the us government has been throwing can continue without foreigners buying our debt we have added more than   trillion dollars to the national debt since the year   and according to boston university economist laurence kotlikoff we are facing unfunded liabilities in future years that are in excess of   trillion dollars even with foreigners continuing to loan us gigantic mountains of super cheap money it would still takea doubling of our taxes to put us on a fiscally sustainable course writing in the september issue of finance and development a journal of the international monetary fund prof kotlikoff says the imf itself has quietly confirmed that the us is in terrible fiscal trouble far worse than the washington based lender of last resort has previously acknowledged the us fiscal gap is huge the imf asserted in a june report closing the fiscal gap requires a permanent annual fiscal adjustment equal to about   per cent of us gdp this sum is equal to all current us federal taxes combined the consequences of the imfs fiscal fix a doubling of federal taxes in perpetuity would be appalling and possibly worse than appalling prof kotlikoff says the imf is saying that to close this fiscal gap by taxation would require an immediate and permanent doubling of our personal income taxes our corporate taxes and all other federal taxes americas fiscal gap is enormous so massive that closing it appears impossible without immediate and radical reforms to its health care tax and social security systems as well as military and other discretionary spending cuts can you afford to pay twice as much in taxes to the federal government very few americans could but that is how serious the financial problems of the federal government are and all of the above assumes that interest payments on us government debt will remain at current levels if the average rate of interest on us government debt rises to just   percent the us government will be paying out a trillion dollars a year just in interest on the national debt also all of the above assumes that we will have a healthy financial system that does not need to be bailed out again but if rapidly rising interest rates cause the   trillion dollar interest rate derivatives bubble to implode the bailout that the too big to fail banks will need will likely be far far larger than last time in fact once that bubble bursts there probably will not be enough money in the entire world to fix it if the picture that i have painted above sounds bleak that is because it is bleak sometimes i get frustrated with myself because i dont feel i am communicating the tremendous danger that we are facing accurately enough we are heading for the worst financial crisis in modern human history and the debt fueled prosperity that we are enjoying today is going to go away and it is never going to come back you can dismiss that as doom and gloom and stick your head in the sand if you want but that isnt going to help anything instead of ignoring reality you should be working hard to prepare your family for what is coming and warning others that they should be getting prepared too when a hurricane is approaching landfall you dont take your family out for a picnic at the beach that would be foolish unfortunately way too many americans are acting as if nothing like the financial crisis of   could ever possibly happen again if you deceive yourself into thinking that all of this is going to have a happy ending somehow you are going to get blindsided by the coming storm but if you make preparations now you might just be okay there is hope in understanding what is happening and there is hope in getting prepared so watch the yield on   year us treasuries the higher it goes the later in the game we are this article first appeared here at the economic collapse michael snyder is a writer speaker and activist who writes and edits his own blogs the american

3,japan passes new war bill legalizes imperialismby brandon turbeville a main component of the new laws is an end to the ban on the right of collective self defense defending another country particularly the united states if it were to come under attack or in instances where japan faces a threat to its survival ie where japan must defend its national interests under the japanese constitution the japanese military could only be used in cases of self defense hence the designation of self  defense army those restrictions have largely been removed as a result of the passage of the new bills the bills had already passed the lower house of the japanese parliament and were passed by the upper house in the early hours of saturday prime minister shinzo abe stated the legislation was necessary to protect the peoples lives and peaceful way of living and is for the purpose of preventing wars protesters disagree however and fear a coming war and a tendency to move toward the perpetual war state and war economy of the united states as quoted by the los angeles times many protesters have been vocal about these concerns when abe was running for election there wasnt a word about security legislation all we heard was abenomics abenomics yokoi   a retiree from tokyos suburbs said as she stood in front of the legislature monday evening then as soon as hes elected hes putting the war bills out there thats just sneaky and underhanded thats not democracy yokoi is hardly alone since june tens of thousands of demonstrators have repeatedly surrounded japans parliament or diet and gathered in cities across the nation to express their discontent with the proposed security legislation signs have read abandon the war bill and we wont be fooled again we wont go to war again organizers claimed    showed up at the diet on monday evening although there was no independent confirmation of that figure  mothers against war a small group founded in july has collected nearly    signatures protesting the bills its members have taken to holding up signs at rallies saying i wont let anyone kill anyones children perhaps one of the most prescient statements was made by protester miki tsukamoto a working mother with a   yearold boy everyones life is important i think members of the self defense forces will quit maybe the only way to get troops will be a draft she said and if not by force there will be a sort of economic draft in which the less fortunate are lured by promise of economic rewards for service were becoming like america thats frightening indeed it seems ms tsukamotos fears are becoming realized it only remains to be seen how long it will be before japan becomes entangled in a destructive foreign adventure the lessons of history appear to have a very short shelf life brandon turbeville article archive here is an author out of florence south carolina he has a bachelors degree from francis marion university and is the author of six books codex alimentarius the end of health freedom   real conspiracies five sense solutions and dispatches from a dissident volume   and volume   and the road to damascus the anglo american assault on syria turbeville has published over   articles dealing on a wide variety of subjects including health economics government corruption and civil liberties brandon turbevilles podcast truth on the tracks can be found every monday night   pm est at ucytv he is available for radio and tv interviews please contact activistpost at gmailcom in the end the central bankers own you and your bananas chimpzoo apeboy japan pm speaking to the japanese bonobos   percent of japanese support the destruction of the pacifist constitution scary i teach at one conservative university in tokyo which graduates a lot of police if your iq is approaching zero you have a good chance of admission and graduation with honors the rest of the vast herd of bonobos are apathetic frankly radioactive disneyland is open and the olympics stadium will be built with tax money stolen from the hard working dwindling middle class such is life richard wilcox reporting from tokyo deport yoko ono yeah apparently there are not too many japanese left who experienced hiroshima and nagasaki and who have a renewed appetite for total destruction well its a thought and something to use all our increasingly stale nuclear arsenal upon sarc well thats the course of nature and history each civilization has a beginning and an end

1,wikileaks just finished the job that started few months ago hillary just got killed she is not going to survive this its too much pure treason   according to conservative daily post barack hussein obama and hillary clinton are the founders of isis we have proven that through emails and documents leaked from wikileaks but liberal media outlets still refuse to cover it   after all they are still more focused on what trump said eleven years ago than what hillary has actually done   because of brave patriots like julian assange we have been given more evidence that hillary clinton is more connected to isis than we originally believed   an email was leaked between clinton and john podesta indicating that western intelligence us intelligence and sources in the region to accuse qatar and saudi arabia of providing clandestine financial and logistic support to isil or isis and other radical sunni groups in the region   citing the need to use our diplomatic and more traditional intelligence assets said hillary to podesta while arguing the current developments in the middle east were important to the us for reasons that often differ from country to country   odd that clinton argues saudi arabia and qatar are helping fund isis when hillarys largest donations come from those two countries   in another correspondence from   the director of foreign policy at the clinton foundation amitabh desai set up a meeting with bill clinton for five minutes in exchange for a     birthday check   the email adds that the small but rich nation occupying the qatar peninsula would welcome the clinton foundations suggestions for investments in haiti  particularly on education and health desai added that while qatar had already allocated most of their   million  they were happy to consider projects we suggest
3,smart meter case testimony before the pennsylvania public utility commission what no one wants to acknowledge about emf damage part   of  by catherine j frompovich because theres a real possibleprobable link between electromagnetic fields and cancer i submit into the record the whoiarc class  b carcinogen classification as exhibit b     pages to further expand upon the whos carcinogen classification i introduce exhibit b   radiofrequency and mammary carcinogenesis in rats the ramazzini study since the definitive rfemf cancer cause has been a subject of deliberate controversy for several decadesreminiscent of the health issues and problems vested interests like big tobacco asbestos lead pb and pharmaceutical prescription drugs also created in the past im compelled to include a few in my testimony remember how cigarettestobacco didnt cause cancer and more doctors smoked camels than any other cigarettes  how many doctors smoke cigarettes today furthermore recall that one time apparently safe asbestos building materials were used everywhere only to be found to cause mesothelioma  thereby closing andor retrofitting schools and public buildings to eliminate exposure to it  recall how lead pb in paints  and gasoline once were dangerously ubiquitous today all gasoline is leadfree by federal law  and there are no lead based paints when will the pa puc come up to speed on microwave technology and ami smart meter rfsemfs microwave rfs and emfs currently are in the same category of those health producing horrors of the past i just mentioned but no one is listening now why arent they those who sound the alarm and protest are harassed bullied and prosecuted what will it take before we have a major health catastrophe from microwave non ionizing radiation poisoning and cancers one specific reason to oppose ami smart meters is those meters insatiable spewing     of harmonics and dirty electricity every   seconds on to home electric wires thereby creating a microwave oven like effect within residences where families and pets are exposed constantly but cannot turn off the ami smart meter like they can their microwave ovens cell phones tvs etc furthermore one cancer is on the upswing from microwave rfsemfs glioblastomasa certain type of brain cancer see exhibit c emfacts consultancys microwave news one type of brain tumor is going up the deadliest kind wherein despite all the media and vested interest contradictionswhich are the real problem in microwave technologythe deadliest and most virulent type of brain tumor gbms is increasing and childrens brains are the most vulnerable because of their small body mass and growing bodies i want to introduce the principle of culpability at law as exhibit d   wherein due to the pa puc and peco choosing to deliberately disregard prominent medical and scientific information and apparently choose to rely upon   to   year old radar safety studies that do not address non thermal health damages that were not acknowledged back then but definitely are now all entities are legally culpable due to willful negligence plus deliberate omission of providing safe non thermal dirty electricity free non rfemf electric service to customersconsumers as they did for decades prior to retrofitting ami smart meters in exhibit d   there are   neurological effects from rfs identified and known as far back and published in february   which frompovich respectfully points out and also asks why the pa puc has not taken them into consideration is that an omission of state agency duty since those non thermal adverse health effects have been acknowledged and published over   years ago whats your excuse may i ask and also have your answer please as exhibit e i introduce a   minute youtube video the dark side of smart meters which can be accessed at this url address httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvflectasg  u  please take note of the information at these timeframes              and   and which are noted in outline fashion in the exhibit e video attachment i prepared as exhibit f i introduce the journal of microscopy and ultrastructure article why children absorb more microwave radiation than adults the consequences keyword carcinogen attached is that   page printed journal article as exhibit g i introduce the published journal article exposure limits the underestimation of absorbed cell phone radiation especially in children cell phones and ami smart meters operate on microwave technology but the one undeniable difference is you can turn off a cell phone you cannot turn off an ami smart meter rfsemfs which transmit     thereby preventing and eliminating any informed consumer choice creating and implementing a forced health hazard mandate with no viable process for relief andor redress at the commonwealth levels of governance and administrationa most unusual legal place for the pa puc and the state to find themselves i contend as exhibit h i introduce emfs and changes in the complete blood count a   page exhibit noting the changes that artificial emfs produce in bone marrow and all blood cells platelets globules etc it should be noted that dirty electricity coming off ami smart meters onto and into house wires creates high spike radiation almost equivalent to phone masts or relay antenna with   citations to that effect in exhibit h such changes have great impact on blood cell physiology including blood cancers as exhibit i i introduce the american academy of environmental medicines   page report electromagnetic and radiofrequency fields effect on human health attached and available online at httpswwwaaemonlineorgemfrfpositionphp  which includes a bibliography of   resources as exhibit j i introduce microwave sickness with a cover sheet explanation   video explanations with online url addresses and the oxford university press publication microwave sickness a reappraisal   pages attached and online at httpoccmedoxfordjournalsorgcontent   long as exhibit k i introduce the microwave syndrome a   page printed report and online at httpmext uporgpdfmicrowavesyndrome ukpdf  plus an overview which outlines the most usual pathologies resulting from the microwave syndrome including breast cancer something frompovich is familiar with and wants to avoid as a breast cancer survivor attention needs to be focused on brain pathology tumors opening of the blood brain barrier electroencephalogram disturbances how do ami smart meter rfsemfs affect those with add adhd and autism why are the pa puc peco and the pa state legislature so intent in causing harm and in particular carcinogenic exposures for children and older citizens by mandating a cancer causing technology be attached to everyones home business school and workplace as exhibit l i introduce us military role in deterring safe radiowaves microwaves unclassified document this is the most damning information no one wants to know or accept since it documents the us militarys resistance to lowering the guidelines and their distrust of research conducted in the eastern bloc countries that distrust and the power wielded by the us military are largely responsible for the status of the current grossly deficient guidelines which fail to protect the publics and workers health two disturbing paragraphs in the us army document biological effects of electromagnetic radiation radiowaves and microwaves eurasian communist countries u prepared by us army medical intelligence and information agency office of the surgeon general et al clearly indicate the us militarys perspective opposing more stringent guidelines to microwave radiation the second disturbing paragraph is most notable should subsequent research result in adoption of the soviet standard by other countries industries whose practices are based on less stringent safety regulations could be required to make costly modifications in order to protect workers recognition of the    mwcm     milliwatts per centimeter squared standard could also limit the application of new technology by making the commercial exploitation of some products unattractive because of increased cost imposed by the need for additional safeguards page   cjf emphasis added that report can be found at httpwwwmagdahavascompick of the week   research on biological effects of radio frequency radiation in eurasian communist countries   the same can be applied to microwave technology depending upon  s outdated information when there is over a half century of updated emfrf science the microwave industry refuses to accept and which the reasons for preventing safety are stated in the us army intelligence report mentioned above is that collusion and therefore illegal however i want to bring to your attention what the us navy is doing now regarding emf research the office of naval research httpwwwonrnavymil onr is an organization within the us department of the navy that coordinates executes and promotes the science and technology programs of the us navy and marine corps through schools universities government laboratories nonprofit organizations and for profit organizations due to the rapid development of high power directed energy weapons technology the onr is supporting research that explores new materials and protection schemes of electromagnetically sensitive components from high power incident radiation  cjf emphasis added doesnt that tell you that high power radiation and electromagnetic sensitives are scientifically recognized under which rocks are pecos scientists hiding to avoid knowing about updated emf science thats more current than the  s there are mammoth amounts of research studies of updated emfrf research that totally discredits pecos world war ii vintage emf safety studies if only peco and the pa puc were honest enough to look for and accept them not deny them in order to perpetuate some insidious control agenda that harms the publics health and wellbeing may i respectfully remind all parties involved in the microwave technologys unscientific game being played regarding no non thermal adverse health effects non administrative law courts look quite differently upon failure to warn about cancer when the probabilities are known a classic case is johnson johnsons baby talcum powder causing an alabama womans ovarian cancer and for which her estate won a   million  award because jj knew what the talc could do disregarded the facts plus didnt warn the buying public jj still has    lawsuits pending personally id like to see a similar turn of events take place for utility companies and the pa puc regarding emfsrfs as exhibit m i introduce a   page printed overview of non thermal electromagnetic health effects peer review papers published online at pubmed which includes cancer and carcinogenic potentials as exhibit n i introduce the   page report of partial findings from the national toxicology program carcinogenesis studies of cell phone radiofrequency radiation in hsd sprague dawley rats whole body exposure made public in may of   available online at httpbiorxivorgcontentbiorxivearly    fulpdf  since that report has so many pages ive elected not to attach a print copy but i include a   page overview us government study finds that wireless causes cancer with links to news stories while pointing out pertinent information on pages   malignant gliomatumors   schwannomas in the heart   lesion descriptions in the brain and heart and pages   and   the ntp study performed by a federal government agency the national institute of environmental health sciences niehs consequently bears legal weight which the pa puc utilities business and industry must accept as valid scientific information otherwise be liable for and charged with culpability under the law frompovich offers as exhibit o i introduce the graphic radiofrequency research does funding matter that illustrates rf research done by non industry studies confirm   harmful effects and   no effects which i held up before as a show and tell poster whereas industry sponsored studies confirm only   harmful effects with   no effects since these figures just about cancel out each other the national toxicology program may   study obviously has to be taken seriouslyalong with the precautionary principleby the pa puc and utility companies furthermore it ought to be apparent from the exhibits ive introduced that microwave peco promoted emf science obviously is willfully lagging on how electromagnetic fields a form of low energy non ionizing radiation could andor does cause cancer and other health anomalies and problems where is pecos current microwave technology science not that from the  s that technological lag i offer probably is by deliberate design as was tobaccos pseudoscience for umpteen years before and until the   surgeon generals report on smoking and health

examines the content of most advertising one can find a parallel to this using nonsense which implies some startling conclusion and then there are the disclaimers at the endbottom the worst of it all is the selling of a malady then selling a drug to treat the symptoms late night tv is a continuous parade of this little subterfuge are we still falling for this scam what fools these mortals be willy

3,vermont governor signs sweeping privacy law hinders several federal surveillance programsby mike maharrey the new law bans warrantless use of stingray devices to track the location of phones and sweep up electronic communications restricts the use of drones for surveillance by police and generally prohibits law enforcement officers from obtaining electronic data from service providers without a warrant or a judicially issued subpoena sen tim ashe sen joe benning and sen dick sears prefiled senate bill   s  in december as filed the legislation addressed the use of drones by vermont law enforcement and placed some additional limits on storage and sharing of data collected by alprs an amendment in a senate committee added provisions to limit warrantless collection of electronic data amendments in the house banned the warrantless use of stingray devices and ultimately put off significant changes to current alpr law gov shumlin signed s  into law on june   it will go into effect in stages extension of the current alpr statue went into effect immediately along with study requirements minor changes to current alpr law will go into effect july   sections relating to drones stingrays and warrantless data collection become effective oct   the new law virtually bans the use of cell site simulators known as stingrays these devices essentially spoof cell phone towers tricking any device within range into connecting to the stingray instead of the tower allowing law enforcement to sweep up communications content as well as locate and track the person in possession of a specific phone or other electronic device under the new statute law enforcement can only use stingrays to track a fugitive with a warrant a law enforcement officer shall not use a device which via radio or other electromagnetic wireless signal intercepts in real time from a users device a transmission of communication content real time cellular tower derived location information or real time gps derived location information except for purposes of locating and apprehending a fugitive for whom an arrest warrant has been issued s  bars the use of any drone mounted facial recognition technology on any person other than one named specifically in a warrant the legislation also prohibits arming drones with a dangerous or deadly weapon or firing any type of projectile from an unmanned aircraft s  prohibits law enforcement from obtaining electronic information and data from service providers without a warrant or subpoena in most situations this includes emails web browsing history call and text message content location information and files stored on third party servers such as the cloud the legislation allows warrantless collection of data in emergency situations but law enforcement must apply for a warrant within five days if the judge rejects the warrant application all information must be destroyed the law allows warrantless collection of electronic data under judicially recognized exceptions to the warrant requirement with the owners consent or if the electronic device is found in possession of a correctional facility inmate s  allows service providers to voluntarily give information to law enforcement any data so gathered must be destroyed within   days unless the law enforcement agency obtains a court order authorizing retention or with consent of the sender or recipient of the information the legislation provides a legal remedy for anybody surveilled in violation of the law a defendant in a trial hearing or proceeding may move to suppress electronic information obtained or retained in violation of the us constitution the vermont constitution or this chapter as passed s  makes some tweaks to vermont law relating to license plate readers but more significant changes were amended out of the bill current law was set to sunset this year it will now remain in place until   presumably the legislature will have to address the issue next year under current law the state can retain alpr data up to   months and share it with other law enforcement agencies including federal during that time frame the legislature needs to place tighter restrictions on the storage and sharing of alpr data next session as it stands information could easily end up in permanent federal databases the federal government funds the vast majority of state and local stingray programs attaching one important condition the feds require agencies acquiring the technology to sign non disclosure agreements this throws a giant shroud over the program even preventing judges prosecutors and defense attorneys from getting information about the use of stingrays in court the feds actually instruct prosecutors to withdraw evidence if judges or legislators press for information as the baltimore sun reported last fall a baltimore detective refused to answer questions on the stand during a trial citing a federal non disclosure agreement defense attorney joshua insley asked cabreja about the agreement does this document instruct you to withhold evidence from the states attorney and circuit court even upon court order to produce he asked yes cabreja said as privacysosorg put it the fbi would rather police officers and prosecutors let criminals go than face a possible scenario where a defendant brings a fourth amendment challenge to warrantless stingray spying the feds sell the technology in the name of anti terrorism efforts with non disclosure agreements in place most police departments refuse to release any information on the use of stingrays but information obtained from the tacoma police department revealed that it uses the technology primarily for routine criminal investigations some privacy advocates argue that stingray use can never happen within the parameters of the fourth amendment because the technology necessarily connects to every electronic device within range not just the one held by the target and the information collected by these devices undoubtedly ends up in federal data bases the feds can share and tap into vast amounts of information gathered at the state and local level through a system known as the information sharing environment or ise in other words stingrays create the potential for the federal government to track the movement of millions of americans with no warrant no probable cause and without the people even knowing it according to its website the ise provides analysts operators and investigators with information needed to enhance national security these analysts operators and investigators have mission needs to collaborate and share information with each other and with private sector partners and our foreign allies in other words ise serves as a conduit for the sharing of information gathered without a warrant the federal government encourages and funds stingrays at the state and local level across the us thereby undoubtedly gaining access to a massive data pool on americans without having to expend the resources to collect the information itself by placing restrictions on stingray use state and local governments limit the data available that the feds can access in a nutshell without state and local cooperation the feds have a much more difficult time gathering information this would representa major blow to the surveillance state and a win for privacy although s  focuses exclusively on state and local drone use and does not apply directly to federal agencies it throws a high hurdle in front of some federal programs much of the funding for drones at the state and local level comes from the federal government in and of itself a constitutional violation in return federal agencies tap into the information gathered by state and local law enforcement through fusion centers and a federal program known as the information sharing environment according to its website the ise provides analysts operators and investigators with information needed to enhance national security these analysts operators and investigators have mission needs to collaborate and share information with each other and with private sector partners and our foreign allies in other words ise serves as a conduit for the sharing of information gathered without a warrant the federal government encourages and funds a network of drones at the state and local level across the us thereby gaining access to a massive data pool on americans without having to expend the resources to collect the information itself by placing restrictions on drone use state and local governments limit the data available that the feds can access in a nutshell without state and local cooperation the feds have a much more difficult time gathering information this represents a major blow to the surveillance state and a win for privacy by allowing defendants to suppress information obtained in violation of the law s  would effectively stop one practical effect of nsa spying in vermont reuters revealed the extent of such nsa data sharing with state and local law enforcement in an august   article according to documents obtained by the news agency the nsa passes information to police through a formerly secret dea unit known special operations divisions and the cases rarely involve national security issues almost all of the information involves regular criminal investigations not terror related investigations in other words not only does the nsa collect and store this data using it to build profiles the agency encourages state and local law enforcement to violate the fourth amendment by making use of this information in their day to day investigations this is the most threatening situation to our constitutional republic since the civil war binney said michael maharrey send him email is the communications director for the tenth amendment center where this article first appeared he proudly resides in the original home of the

medical marijuana they are looking better better too bad winters are so friggin cold but then theres global warming i live in vermont it is a police state among the highest property taxes in the country marxists and darwinists everwhere unmarked cars and speed traps these new laws protect the vt government from being spied on they get official plates that dont show up in the plate readers so they dont care here in oregon we all watched via drone the assassination of this really cool rancher that the governor of oregon hillary and obama ordered and now it is being forgotten whoa this entire episode in harney county burns oregon was the epitomy of our feds gone bad if you havent watched this you should this is a crucial situation that shows how little we matter to the feds the only thing we learned is that youd better keep your mouth shut if you are having problems with the feds way overstepping their job descriptions go look this up it is a wake up call that the feds have been able to poo poo away i would be interested in buying a diffusion mechanism it would be nice if someone actually came up with a counter to all this

2,obama announces new rules that will put american gun owners in jail for this its no secret that obama has been on a mission to destroy the second amendment and eliminate guns in america now his state department is proposing new restrictions that would make it illegal for gun owners to discuss guns and ammo on the internet without explicit federal permission for the average america that would mean undergoing the cumbersome and time consuming process of obtaining the proper authorizations any individual caught violating the rule could be fined up to   million and could be facing a prison sentence of up to   years this latest regulatory assaultis as much an affront to the first amendment as it is to the second the nra claimed adding that the measure is essentially a gag order on firearm related speech what do you think is this absolutely outrageous
1,almost on the eve of the   presidential election outgoing president barack obama issued an executive order that is intended to coordinate all the worlds health agencies in alignment with the cdcs intention to increase detainment and quarantining guidelines enforcement worldwide   executive orders eo are legally binding as laws though an incoming president can issue eos to cancel or revise some of those issued by the previous president they are handy for an administration to avoid congressional delays and conflicts which can create unfavorable amendments or nullifying it completely   congress can also amend executive orders and the supreme court can nullify them but those are lengthy and give the administration involved time to enforce the executive order through the executive branches several agencies including the cdc and the department of health and human services   the executive branch can end around congress to create statutes and enforceable policies with executive orders euphemistically called presidential memoranda these days executive order to be used against vaccine resistance   this recent executive order is of grave concern for advocates of health freedom it is called advancing the global health security agenda to achieve a world safe and secure from infectious disease threats and it was signed and issued on november   th      it seems innocuous at first glance but one set of initials shows up often ghsa  it stands for global health security agenda   this term first appeared in a cdc proposal in   during the disney measles outbreak this proposal focused mostly on its vaccine package it rested comfortably on the nationally orchestrated outcry against vaccination resistance  some journalists even suggested jailing parents who did not have their children vaccinated
2,breaking obama is looking at major jail time because of this president obama has been facing accusations from congress that his executive actions are illegal for some time now now a watchdog group has reportedly found a way to stop the president before he has the chance to make another damaging unilateral decision according to reports judicial watch is calling on congress to request the government accountability office to look into unauthorized expenditures of federal funds to determine whether they are in violation of the antideficiency act specially they want to determine whether congress has authorized or appropriated the funds needed for us citizenship and immigration services to implement obamas deferred action for childhood arrivals or lawful permanent residents program according to the government watch group if the funds have not been appropriated they want to know to what extent of the funds being used were supposed to go to other measures judicial watch president tom fitton believes that the investigation will reveal that uscis has already started spending funds without proper authority this unauthorized spending may be a direct violation of the antideficiency act which makes it a violation of law with potential civil and criminal penalties for government officials to spend monies that have not been appropriated by congress fitton stated the code prohibits any officer or employee of the federal government from spending a single dollar without proper authorization from congress violation of the code carries criminal penalties an officer or employee of the united states government or of the district of columbia government knowingly and willfully violating section  a or   of this title shall be fined note more than    imprisoned for not more than   years or both the bill reads that means that if the president was found guilty of a violation he could be served both penalties what do you think does obama belong behind bars and not in the white house
1,there are two worlds in a way never before imagined one of people and jobs of life and experience the other a shadowy world of deceit and terrorism  as the month of march   comes to an end and april begins the entire planet is being tested as expected as promised as any idiot might guess political leadership has failed and the organizations intended to coordinate the planetary response to biological threats has shown itself to be politicized weakened or possibly worse  on march     the berman law group of boca raton florida filed a   trillion lawsuit against the government of china for creating and disseminating the covid   virus which has well we dont really know  one has to remind ones self of our times a few years ago what was termed an arab spring emerged largely manipulated by militarized subsidiaries of google and facebook funded by totalitarian regimes aligned with the us  spring as it turned out means something different to the people of the middle east the social reformers of the west delivered head choppers and islamists stolen oil and looted factories and not so much democracy as promised  then as so easily predicted those who brought the disease thus offered the cure coalition bombings occupation drone assassination and unending suffering  in ukraine spring meant false flag snipers and downing an airliner followed by a descent into politics more familiar to those who studied the last century and the fascist attempt to rule the world  nothing is as it seems nothing seen can be believed nothing read is true nothing taught exists all is flimflammery and bluster buffoonery and mayhem  well what does one see living in the united states one sees a lockdown of a nation for one two three or more months what one doesnt see is where exactly   million people are how they live where the money comes from to feed them and what the sinking feeling of hopelessness is doing to them  for the haves well financed retirees or medical workers not yet infected life may be changed even grim but it will continue  quite recently a number of publications began spreading the rumor that   million chinese mobile phone users had simply disappeared meaning that they had died of covid   and were now in mass graves  this type of story is common and such things spring up almost daily the reason isnt simple a sea of absurd lies is manufactured by think tanks in order to drown those gems of embarrassing truth that escaped the google censors or the control of the corporate media  here in the us the concern is generated by driving past miles of closed factories stores and restaurants the government plans to send out small checks to cover up to   of economic losses of the working poor who were always no more than   weeks from homelessness  now they cant be thrown out on the street not for awhile anyway law has prevented this but the lost income will never be replaced income that paid insurance health care for children bought food and clothing and that american lifestyle of fast food cable television and continual texting  those jobs the restaurants and shops many of the factories no longer exist no bail out can save them in a permanently retracted economy that will never be able to reabsorb millions of workers whose livelihood was governed by economic fakery  where two weeks before stores were emptied now the money that financed buying carloads of toilet paper has dwindled away  no one talks of this no one reports this no one asks where   million americans are how they feed their kids how they spend their days and how fear is playing on their vulnerability  there is no social welfare state in america the benefits for retirees medicare and social security are being chipped away by conservative politics  health care for veterans and there are many millions of former military whose lives were destroyed while america destroyed the middle east has disappeared unspoken of and unreported  veterans are being told they are being removed from health care and can no longer be treated including and especially the totally disabled combat veterans supplies dont exist the pharmacies are out of medications and it didnt start with covid   it began with donald trump veterans health care the largest health care system in the world disappeared when no one was looking it is dead and gone  it will never be reported no organization will complain to congress because you see if you arent a bank or oil company one of those with their hands out for   trillion in free money from the trump regime you dont exist  a few paragraphs ago we mentioned the massive lawsuit against china the assumption that china created covid   is based on an important research paper written in   that tied a research facility in wuhan to a study on a bat virus that created something capable of infecting the world a disease exactly like covid    this is the origin of the blame china ploy just like the blame russia for fake gas attacks in syria or when the kiev regime shot down mh   all that was needed was a fake court fake evidence and controlled media  with the accusation against china all that is needed is for china to be tied in this case for supplying a virus to a dangerous terror group to a global pandemic  the terror group as we discovered was the usaid a cia affiliate that used the wuhan virus to create something frightening at the university of north carolina not in wuhan  a lawsuit and trial will condemn china in a rigged american court experts so many experts who saw china defeat the disease in weeks while it has run rampant across the us have come to believe that the us was always the origin and that covid   had been around for some time inside the us before showing up in china  what is strange is that some questions are never asked why so many die in northern italy the best hospitals in the world are there no transportation hubs no ties to wuhan and no bio warfare labs are they being experimented on  then we have detroit another anomaly a city of all private homes a city filled with poor a disease spread rapidly through a community that uses no public transportation and that has been housebound by weather for months  no one looks for a patient zero or super spreader a term used in studies on bio terrorism  the other untold story is the restructuring of americas employment environment no trade unions anymore no contracts no benefits no guarantees the war on the worker that reagan began and bush   won behind the smokescreen of    and the fake war on terror  you see injured workers seldom qualify for benefits and those laid off because of economic slowdowns are denied benefits though processes of fake accusations and legal trickery  it gets worse if you are injured on a job lets say a piece of heavy equipment breaks and you are seriously injured not only will you likely never receive wage compensation but you are likely to be denied needed medical care as well medical treatment is often withheld other than enough to make sure you dont die right away until a hearings process is exhausted which can take up to two years during that time a physical injury will often lead to permanent crippling and care when it becomes available eventually is palliative only often opiate pain relievers  this is what is meant when it is said that the social welfare safetynet in the us has disappeared  this is where   million americans without hope now live to fend for themselves and watch television being told day and night to hate china and wait for a check with donald trumps signature that might buy tires for a car that was repossessed  gordon duff is a marine combat veteran of the vietnam war that has worked on veterans and pow issues for decades and consulted with governments challenged by security issues hes a senior editor and chairman of the board of veterans today especially for the online magazine new eastern outlook
2,liberals are furious after black chicago police chief begs trump for help with huge crime rate liberals were furious when donald trump tweeted chicago murder rate is record setting   shooting victims with   murders in   if mayor cant do it he must ask for federal help of course liberal news networks immediately labeled trump as a racist for his commentsthat is until the chicago police board chairwoman stood behind trumps comments chairwoman lori lightfoot admitted that if chicago wants to improve their crime rates they will need trumps help we need to have more federal gun prosecutions in chicago she commented our federal partners from the us attorneys office the atf the fbi need to be much more invested in this overall strategy chicago police department cannot tackle this issue by itself lightfoot then commented on the flaws in the re entry system this is not a problem that were going to arrest our way out of she added were dealing with a huge re entry problemliterally thousands of people coming back from the illinois department of corrections to the same communities that they left and those communities just dont have the resources right now to absorb that huge influx of re entry though trump has been unpopular in his claims that we need to target criminals not guns that sentiment was also argued by lightfoot so weve got to tackle the problem its not sexy its not popular but if were going to really get at the root causes of a lot of this gun violence weve got to deal with these issues as well she concluded in chicago we are in a state of crisis we need all hands on deck what do you think is trump the right person to help turn chicagos crime rates around
3,obama announces more special forces troops to syria escalates existing policyby brandon turbeville in his speech at hannover germany obama stated just as i approved additional support for iraqi forces against isil ive decided to increase us support for local forces fighting isil in syria a small number of special operations forces are already on the ground in syria and their expertise has been critical as local forces have driven isil out of key areas so given their success ive approved the deployment of up to   additional us personnel in syria including special forces to keep up this momentum obama made a point to state that the troops will not be leading the fight on the ground but will be engaged in training and providing assistance to local forces obama also restated the us position that assad must go when he said just as we remain relentless on the military front were not going to give up on diplomacy to end the civil war in syria because the suffering of the people in syria has to end and that requires an effective political transition cnn reports that the troops will be expanding the ongoing us effort to bring more syrian arab fighters into units the us supports in northern syria that have largely been manned by the kurds an official told cnn earlier the plan calls for the additional us forces to advise and assist forces in the area whom the us hopes may eventually grow strong enough to take back territory around raqqa syria where isis is based these troops are not expected to engage in combat operations or to participate in target to kill teams but will be armed to defend themselves one official said      the official said the president was persuaded to take this additional step because of recent successes against isis what these statements mean of course is that the united states is deploying troops to better assist train and organize the terrorists on the ground who are fighting assad and the syrian military after all these fighters that the us supports are nothing more than isis al qaeda fsa nusra and other numerous groups and groupiscules that are ideologically identical to one another and whose only real tangible difference is the names they themselves not only that any talk of recent successes against isis is clearly not the successes of the united states nato or the anti syria coalition they are the successes of syria iran hezbollah and russia indeed the latter forces have achieved in weeks what the former could not achieve in over a year ten years according to the us a true testament to what can be achieved when one actually targets the terrorist organization as opposed to supporting it still it is important to point out that regardless of obamas recent announcement us special forces have been present in syria for quite some time with nato member special forces known publicly even earlier in october   it was announced by the white house that   special forces troops would be sent to syria this announcement came days after it was reported that us special forces commandos were working with kurdish forces to free prisoners of the islamic state in syria later the presence of us special forces in syria was tacitly acknowledged in   when the us took credit for the killing of abu sayyaf reports circulated in october   that us soldiers and special forces troops were fighting alongside kurdish battalions in kobane an article by christof lehmann published in march     stated evidence about the presence of us special forces in the syrian town ayn al arab aka kobani emerged troops are guiding us airstrikes as part of us support for the kurdish separatist group pyd and the long established plan to establish a kurdish corridor a photo taken in ayn al arab shows three us soldiers one of them peter is carrying a bushnell laser rangefinder an instrument designed to mark targets for us jets reports ceyhun bozkurt for aydinlik daily the photo substantiated previous bbc interviews with us soldiers who are fighting alongside the kurdish separatist group pyd in syria the photo of the three us troopers also substantiates a statement by pyd spokesman polat can from october     reports aydinlik daily can admitted that a special unit in kobani provides kurdish fighters with the coordinates of targets which then would be relayed to coalition forces the first public us special forces raid in syria took place in july   when delta force personnel allegedly attempted to rescue several americans being held by isis near raqqa allegedly the soldiers stormed the facility but the terrorists had already moved the hostages while the raid would provide evidence that us special forces were operating in syria in   many researchers believe the story is simply fabricated by the white house to provide legitimacy to the stories of murdered hostages and thus the subsequent pro war propaganda that ensued as well as to promote the gradual acceptance of us troops on the ground in syria in   an article published in the daily star by deborah sherwood revealed that sas special forces and mi  agents were operating inside syria shortly after the destabilization campaign began in earnest sherwood writes special forces will help protect the refugees in syria along the borders last week as the president ignored an international ceasefire plans were being finalised to rescue thousands of syrians sas troops and mi  agents are in the country ready to help rebels if civil war breaks out as expected this weekend they also have hi tech satellite computers and radios that can instantly send back photos and details of refugees and assads forces as the situation develops whitehall sources say it is vital they can see what is happening on the ground for themselves so assad cannot deny atrocities or battles and if civil war breaks out the crack troops are on hand to help with fighting said the insider      safe havens would be an invasion of syria but a chance to save lives said a senior

invite the us to enter its territory then the us should get the h out the military industrial death machine and its elite scum leaders rolls ever onward plan has been to use isis like a fire and contain it in syria and use kurds to create real civil war and split the countryi predicted this over a year ago and even said that eventually the kurds will present a much bigger problem than isisno

2,obama hides his birthday party from the public for unbelievably sickening reason to earn the support of the american public barack obama has positioned himself as a champion of the middle class when he was still a member of the senate he made himself relatable with discussions of flying coach drinking beer watching sports and driving a chrysler while in the white house his tastes have become increasingly lavish the proof is in how he spent his most recent birthday according to the new york times account of obamas  th the guest list looked suspiciously like the one percent its no surprise that he kept the event secret from the media and urged attendees to stay silent magic johnson was just one of a number of stars who attended the function and ended up leaking the event grant hill alonzo morning george lucas paul mccartney and stevie wonder were among the guests also present was the deplorable reverend al sharpton the truth of the matter is that obama is far departed from the average american just look at how carelessly he spends our hard earned tax dollars
3,the lying liars who lie about psychiatryjon rappoport its a winning strategy because most americans dont have a clue about the way psychiatry actually works or its pose of being a science the public hears techno speak and nods and surrenders if psychiatrists are experts on the human mind mice can navigate the arctic in canoes but psychiatrists are educated to be able to talk a good game and politicians are more than happy to mouth vagaries and consign the problems of society to mental health professionals it turns out that the phrase mental health was invented by psyops specialists who needed to create an analogy to physical well being the needed to because the mind was and is a mystery to psychiatrists an open secret has been slowly bleeding out into public consciousness for the past ten years there are no definitive laboratory tests for any so called mental disorder and along with that all so called mental disorders are concocted named labeled described and categorized by a committee of psychiatrists from menus of human behaviors for years even psychiatrists have been blowing the whistle on this hazy crazy process of research of course pharmaceutical companies who manufacture highly toxic drugs to treat every one of these disorders are leading the charge to invent more and more mental health categories so they can sell more drugs and make more money but we have a mind boggling twist under the radar one of the great psychiatric stars who has been out in front inventing mental disorders went public he blew the whistle on himself and his colleagues and for   years almost no one noticed his name is dr allen frances and he made very interesting statements to gary greenberg author of a wired article inside the battle to define mental illness dec    major media never picked up on the interview in any serious way it never became a scandal dr allen frances is the man who in   headed up the project to write the latest edition of the psychiatric bible the dsm iv this tome defines and labels and describes every official mental disorder the dsm iv eventually listed   of them in an april     new york times piece scientist at work daniel goleman called frances perhaps the most powerful psychiatrist in america at the moment well sure if youre sculpting the entire canon of diagnosable mental disorders for your colleagues for insurers for the government for pharma who will sell the drugs matched up to the   dsm iv diagnoses youre right up there in the pantheon long after the dsm iv had been put into print dr frances talked to wireds greenberg and said the following there is no definition of a mental disorder its bullshit i mean you just cant define it bang thats on the order of the designer of the hindenburg looking at the burned rubble on the ground remarking well i knew there would be a problem after a suitable pause dr frances remarked to greenberg these concepts of distinct mental disorders are virtually impossible to define precisely with bright lines at the borders frances might have been referring to the fact that his baby the dsm iv had rearranged earlier definitions of adhd and bipolar to permit many more diagnoses leading to a vast acceleration of drug dosing with highly powerful and toxic compounds finally at the end of the wired interview frances flew off into a bizarre fantasy diagnosis as spelled out in the dsm iv is part of the magicyou know those medieval maps in the places where they didnt know what was going on they wrote dragons live herewe have a dragons world here but you wouldnt want to be without the map translation patients need hope for the healing of their troubles so even if we psychiatrists are shooting blanks and pretending to know one kind of mental disorder from another even if were inventing these mental disorder definitions based on no biological or chemical diagnostic testsits a good thing because patients will then believe and have hope theyll believe it because psychiatrists place a name on their problems needless to say this has nothing to do with science if i were an editor at one of the big national newspapers and one of my reporters walked in and told me the most powerful psychiatrist in america just said the dsm is sheer bs but its still important i think id make room on the front page if the reporter then added this shrink was in charge of creating the dsm iv id clear more room above the fold if the reporter went on to explain that the whole profession of psychiatry would collapse overnight if the dsm was discredited id call for a special section of the paper to be printed id tell the reporter to get ready to pound on this story day after day for months id tell him to track down all the implications of dr frances statements id open a bottle of champagne to toast the soon to be soaring sales of my newspaper and then of course the next day id be fired because there are powerful multi billion dollar interests at stake and those people dont like their deepest secrets exposed in the press and as i walked out of my job id see a bevy of blank eyed pharmaceutical executives marching into the office of the papers publisher ready to read the riot act to him dr frances work on the dsm iv allowed for more toxic drugs to be prescribed because the definition of bipolar was expanded to include more people adverse effects of valproate given for a bipolar diagnosis include adverse effects of risperdal given for bipolar and irritability stemming from autism include dr frances label juggling act also permitted the definition of adhd to expand thereby opening the door for greater and greater use of toxic ritalin and other similar compounds as the treatment of choice so what about ritalin in   the international journal of the addictions published a most important literature review by richard scarnati it was called an outline of hazardous side effects of ritalin methylphenidate v   pp     scarnati listed a large number of adverse affects of ritalin and cited published journal articles which reported each of these symptoms for every one of the following selected and quoted verbatim ritalin effects there is at least one confirming source in the medical literature a recent survey revealed that a high percentage of children diagnosed with bipolar had first received a diagnosis of adhd this is informative because ritalin and other speed type drugs are given to kids who are slapped with the adhd label speed sooner or later produces a crash this is easy to call clinical depression then comes prozac paxil zoloft these drugs can produce temporary highs followed by more crashes the psychiatrist notices the up and down patternand then produces a new diagnosis of bipolar manic depression and other drugs including valproate and lithium in the us alone there are at least    cases of motor brain damage incurred by people who have been prescribed so called anti psychotic drugs aka major tranquilizers risperdal mentioned above as a drug given to people diagnosed with bipolar is one of those major tranquilizers source toxic psychiatry dr peter breggin st martins press   this psychiatric drug plague is accelerating across the land where are the mainstream reporters and editors and newspapers and tv anchors who should be breaking this story and mercilessly hammering on it week after week they are in harness and dr frances is somehow let off the hook hes admitted in print that the whole basis of his profession is throwing darts at labels on a wall and implies the effort is rather heroicwhen in fact the effort leads to more and more poisonous drugs being dispensed to adults and children to say nothing of the effect of being diagnosed with a mental disorder im not talking about the mental disease stigma the removal of which is one of hillary clintons missions in life no im talking about moving a human into the system the medical apparatus where the essence of the game is trapping that person to harvest his money his time his energy and of course his healthas one new diagnosis follows on another and one new toxic treatment after another is undertaken from cradle to grave the result is a severely debilitated human being if he survives whose major claim to fame is his list of diseases and disorders thank you dr frances here is a smoking gun statement made by another prominent psychiatrist on an episode of pbs frontline series the episode was does adhd exist pbs frontline interviewer skeptics say that theres no biological markerthat it adhd is the one condition out there where there is no blood test and that no one knows what causes it barkley dr russell barkley professor of psychiatry and neurology at the university of massachusetts medical center thats tremendously nave and it shows a great deal of illiteracy about science and about the mental health professions a disorder doesnt have to have a blood test to be valid if that were the case all mental disorders would be invalidthere is no lab test for any mental disorder right now in our science that doesnt make them invalid emphasis added without intending to dr barkley blows the whistle on his own profession so lets take dr barkley to school medical science and disease research in particular rests on the notion that you can make a diagnosis backed up by lab tests if you cant produce lab tests youre spinning fantasies these fantasies might be hopeful they might be educated guesses they might be launched from traditional centers of learning they might be backed up by billions of dollars of grant moneybut theyre still fantasies if i said the moon was made of green cheese even if i were a harvard professor sooner or later someone would ask me to produce a sample of moon rock to be tested for cheese qualities i might begin to feel nervous i might want to tap dance around the issue but i would have to submit the rock to a lab dr barkley employs a version of logical analysis in his statement to the pbs frontline interviewer barkley is essentially saying there is no lab test for any mental disorder but if a test were the standard of proof we wouldnt have science at all and that would mean our whole profession rests on nothingand that is absurd so therefore a test doesnt matter that logic is no logic at all barkley is proving the case against himself he just doesnt want to admit it close to   years ago psychiatry was dying out as a profession fewer and fewer people wanted to see a psychiatrist for help for talk therapy all sorts of new therapies were popping up the competition was leaving medical psychiatry in the dust as dr peter breggin describes it in his landmark book toxic psychiatry a deal was struck drug companies would bankroll psychiatry and rescue it these companies would pour money into professional conferences journals research in return they wanted science that would promote mental disease as a biological fact a gateway into the drugs everyone would winexcept the patient so the studies were rolled out and the list of mental disorders expanded the fda was in on the deal as well as evidenced by their drug safety approvals in the face of the obvious damage these drugs were doing so this is how we arrived at where we are this was the plan and it worked under the cover story it was all fraud all the time without much of a stretch you could say psychiatry has been the most widespread profiling operation in the history of the human race its goal has been to bring humans everywhere into its system it hardly matters which label a person is painted with as long as it adds up to a diagnosis and a prescription of drugs and now in the wake of the aurora and sandy hook shootings it matters even less who or how many people are labeled with mental disorders the more the better as far as government is concerned just as in the old ussr psychiatry becomes an instrument of oppression a way to discredit any person the state wants to silence and destroy in the disputes between the east and west concerning the russian opponents of the soviet regime many dissidents went to lunatic asylums and were treated as mentally sick western doctors and the press accused soviet doctors of being blind instruments of the regime and of having broken the solemn oath of their calling the russian doctors thought the west had gone mad in reproaching their behavior for them anyone who opposed such an efficient police power must be mentally disturbed in their view only those who had what seneca called libido morienti the death wish would dare to provoke the state the russian doctors were convinced that they were undertaking a humanitarian mission by placing the opponents of the regime in asylums and thereby reducing their aggressionthe only hope for their survival to reduce the outstanding to mediocrity was always a medical and human duty in a state where mediocrity had the better chance of survival man the fallen ape by branko bokun jon

2,four senators ban together to take down comey with shocking proof its all over now the obama administration has pulled every trick in the book to try to derail congressman trey gowdys investigation of hillary clinton and fbi director james comey now it appears he has finally made some progress four prominent us senators have just come forward with a letter that hillary and beth wilkinson wrote this past june the letter claims the fbi could only access hillarys emails from between june   and february   the wilkinson letters raise serious questions about why doj would consent to such substantial limitations on the scope of its investigation and how director james comeys statements on the scope of the investigation comport with the reality of what the fbi was permitted to investigate the senators said in a meeting this is simply astonishing given the likelihood that evidence on the laptops would be of interest to congressional investigators these limitations would necessarily have excluded for example any emails from cheryl mills to paul combetta in late   or early   directing the destruction or concealment of federal records congressman jason chaffetz added similarly these limitations would have excluded any email sent or received by secretary clinton if it was not sent or received by one of the four email addresses listed or the email address was altered what do you think will clinton and comey finally see justice
3,power brokers meet at private renaissance weekend ideas festivalbrandon turbeville what surprised me however was that several of the more politically active individuals i spoke to actually began telling me about yet another annual meeting of power brokers that takes place in my own state one which i had never heard of this was particularly surprising considering the proximity of the meetings and the fact that they have been taking place for well over thirty years what they were talking about was the annual renaissance weekend the renaissance weekend began in   and was founded by philip and linda lesourd lader it is a private invitation only gathering of a relatively large number of high  to low level players in us politics the event takes place over an entire weekend and is usually held in eloquent resorts in charleston south carolina in recent years the conference has developed branches in other locations such as aspen co santa monica ca monterey ca napa ca and jackson hole wy renaissance weekends the grand daddy of ideas festivals build bridges among innovative leaders of all ages with exceptionally diverse perspectives unusually candid theprograms are always provocative fueled by a unique interaction of thought leaders trend setters and authorities the attendees are then described in this manner ceos venture capitalists entrepreneurs nobel laureates pulitzer prize winners artists educators scientists astronauts olympians judges diplomats social entrepreneurs non profit leaders change makers of silicon valley hollywood wall street main street professors priests republicans democrats independents to be clear renaissance weekends are not bilderberg this much can be seen by thefact that the overwhelming majority of the participants are americans and also that the organizers are quite open about the conference and who attends it one can even visit the illustrative list of past participants on the official website to get a sense of who is attending the event along with pictures and a brief qualification listing for each person indeed the sheer amount of people attending the conference precludes the cloud of secrecy that surrounds confabs like bilderberg not only that but the levels of true power brokers taking part in renaissance weekends is much lower than that of other private meetings although the meetings are both closed to the public and access is granted by invitation only many low level politicians scientists ceos bankers and academics mostly of the more privileged class of the general population are allowed in thus it is apparent that one need not be part of any conspiracy to be invited to the renaissance weekend however the conference is not merely a gathering of proficient high school students either a quick look at the participants list reveals that much indeed considering the individuals who were instrumental in founding the renaissance weekend we should not be eager to dismiss the event as nothing more than entertainment philip lader and his wife linda lesourd lader both have some interesting insideconnections of their own philip lader for instance has been the us ambassador to the court of st james chairman of the wpp group senior advisor to morgan stanley and a partner in the nelson mullins law firm most notably he is vice chairman of the rand corporation and serves on the boards of marathon oil rusal lloyds of london and aes corporations lader is also on the board of directors of the atlantic council he is a member of the campaign for american leadership in the middle east council of american ambassadors the pilgrims society and the council on foreign relations lader was also the former president of the sea pines company and the executive vice president of sir james goldsmiths us holdings philip laders wife linda lesourd lader is a trustee of the tony blair foundation and communities in schools she has also served on the board of habitat for humanity international international justice mission and harvard divinity schools center for the study of values in public life she also assisted with the white house liaison to american communities of faith and served as an advisor to the president on issues of religion in american culture lader was educated at yale divinity school where she became a fellow at the yale center for faith and culture it should be noted however that a large amount of the attendees to the renaissance weekend do not have biographies anything close to that of the laders or the clintons who also attend these functions indeed many participants have no real official qualifications at all and many of them bring their entire family along as a childrens program camp renaissance is run simultaneous to the adult programs teenagers are also welcome college students can also be invited and are encouraged to blend in to the full program schedule with the other more select guests with this in mind and as i have mentioned earlier renaissance weekend is obviously no bilderberg yet it is no mere educational conference either what renaissance does appear to be is a mix between the higher level worker bees of the true power brokers in society with mid  and low level agents of the system more importantly renaissance may serve as a recruiting ground for future agents of the system whether on a long term or temporary basis by allowing seasoned globalist operatives to mingle with state or local level ladder climbers as well as students and academics with high aspirations those individuals who express desire to manifest their potential within globalist systems are able to be identified for future grooming thus rennaissance can be considered a possible farm team of the general public for the globalist elite which functions in addition to the more traditional methods already in place regardless of the direct influence that discussions at renaissance have on world affairs the conference stands as yet another private event made up of elites government officials financiers corporate operatives and academics that meet largely in secret to discuss public policy and other relevant issues outside of the eye of those they have been elected to serve but while members of the public are often invited after having been vetted we cannot be so nave to think that the real discussions of renaissance take place in the conference halls or in front of large audiences of eager and wide eyed serfs you can support this information by voting on reddit here brandon turbeville is an author out of mullins south carolina he has a bachelors

4,inside a low slung building off a nondescript road in a quiet central new jersey suburb is the most powerful room in golf by the thousands every year people devise ingenious revolutionary and bizarre ideas for improving golf    new clubs balls tees gloves and grips    and all of it ends up in this room these prototypes might represent hours spent tinkering in a garage with an eye on making millions in the case of major golf manufacturers they represent millions of dollars already spent on engineering in either case the work and time invested are broken down in the orderly laboratory of the us golf association research and test center in that space in the modest building surrounded by rolling grassy fields a staff of   decrees which clubs balls grips tees and devices conform to the rules of golf in other words what is considered legal and what is illegal recreational golfers are not required to play with conforming clubs or golf balls that meet certain dimensions and performance restrictions but nearly everyone does just as the professional golf tours are not required to play by usgas rules but each chooses to voluntarily we are not the police and if your submitted idea is not approved you wont be arrested said john spitzer the usgas assistant technical director its just not within the rules being within the rules could be the difference between a great idea left to languish in a garage and a groundbreaking club that finds its way into the bag of a sizable portion of americas   million golfers golf is a   billion industry requesting the usgas stamp of approval for equipment has been going on for decades but in the past   years the number of submissions has more than quintupled from about   in   to more than    in   and that doesnt include golf balls the usga tested    models of those last year everyone is searching for golfs magic bullet spitzer said it is after all a hard game and there have been extraordinary equipment advances    alloys that allow club shapes that hit the ball straighter and balls that last longer and soar farther than ever a majority of submissions to the usga come from golf industry giants like taylormade titleist nike callaway and ping but as much as   percent are sent to the test center in far hills from individuals unaffiliated with any company their submissions run the gamut    three headed putters balls laced with gunpowder gloves with padding promoting a certain grip or tees that prevent a slice each of those ideas was classified as nonconforming there are however just as many ideas if not more that have been accepted last year more than   percent of submissions were approved the most obvious explanation for the increase in submissions is the advancing technology that has overhauled how clubs and balls are constructed newer lighter materials and the advent of computer generated designs have turned the making of a driver    once formed by laminating pieces of wood    from a craft to a marvel of engineering scores of engineers hired by the club manufacturers are trying to outfox the small band of engineers technicians and college professors on the usgas payroll it has become a high stakes science fair the manufacturers engineers know there are specific documented and minute limitations on every facet of golfs equipment from what angle a shaft can be affixed to a club head to the amount of springlike effect permitted in a club face a change this year in the rule governing the shape of the microscopic grooves cut into an iron    measured down to the   th of an inch    roiled the industry for months in this environment the manufacturers are continually trying to find ways to get their new equipment as close to the nonconforming line as possible their contemporaries on the usga test centers staff stand on the other side of the line they are trying to help their customers play better spitzer said we get that and have allowed much progress so were not trying to preserve the game but we are trying to protect it so to make sure every new club is within the rules it faces a battery of tests the shaft is bent and the grip analyzed theres a shadow graph test and another test for checking the clubs moment of inertia the clubs volume is checked and its surface roughness gauged spin rates off the face are calculated    and not just in normal conditions another test uses synthetic fabric to mimic wet grass the golf balls if its possible seem to face additional scrutiny they are weighed measured sometimes sliced open or compressed most are shot by a minicannon through a   foot tunnel past infrared sensors and lasers with dozens of readouts produced other balls are hit by a mechanical golfer across a long driving range where trajectory monitors designed to follow missiles aimed at warships instead wait in the grass to chart the path of each ball even after a ball is deemed to be conforming the usga sleuths are not done they will visit a local dicks sporting goods and buy some of the same balls just to make sure they perform the same as the ones the company submitted for testing the painstaking attention to detail does not end with the testing every person who submits an item including something like the obviously nonconforming three headed putter receives a meticulously written decision after a committee of four meets the submission has a file including all the correspondence involved should the person want to appeal the decision which is allowed the appeal goes to a different committee all the paperwork is kept on file as are all the submitted items more than    are stored at the test center cataloged and kept confidential if all this seems a little much for a game that is principally about hitting a little ball into a little hole those at the usga test center would not entirely disagree it might seem crazy but if we didnt draw some lines it could get out of control pretty easily spitzer said its pretty easy to manipulate a club to hit the ball straight and you could easily make a ball that goes   yards even with an average swing so yes its about hitting a little ball but without the challenge its not a game either its about making the skill of the golfer the most important thing not the golfers equipment spitzer himself is an average golfer a   handicap who has seen in his   years with the usga just about every new club or ball invented by the big golf companies and the mad golf scientists working in their basements so what clubs and balls are in his golf bag his clubs are several years old and far from modern technologically recently when he found new lesser known golf balls discounted to   a dozen perhaps because they were a model soon to be discontinued he bought   boxes if they made a club that prevented me from hitting a chunky chip short of the green spitzer said or if they made a ball that prevented me from blowing my first putt   feet past the hole then i would buy it but they dont right now my best investment would be   in golf lessons
2,donald trump consumed by massive scandal this could be the end while donald trump continues to win over americans throughout the country the liberal media has shifted from attacking him to attacking his family now a new report indicates that a story from   suggesting that trumps father fred trump was arrested during a kkk riot could come back to haunt him according to the article which is yet to be confirmed fred trump was taken into custody during a free for all involving law enforcement and klansmen experts have pointed out that the arrest does not necessarily conclude that trumps father was a member of the group in fact the article merely states that fred was arrested in the near riot of the parade in fact he was discharged immediately after appearing before a judge it is very possible that he was an innocent bystander in the incident or that the fred trump referred to in the article is another person entirely of course trump is vehemently denying the accusations this is ridiculous he told reporters he was never arrested he has nothing to do with this this never happenedits a completely false ridiculous story he was never there thinkif it had he would never have been able to get licenses in new york for anything associated with his business he concluded true or not the reports could come back to haunt trump who has been painted as a white supremacist by liberals

1,the mesa city police departments homicide division is investigating the death of gary lenius the arizona man whose wife served him soda mixed with fish tank cleaner in what she claimed was a bid to fend off the coronavirus inspired by president trumps white house briefings  a detective handling the case confirmed the investigation to the washington free beacon on tuesday after requesting a recording of interviews with leniuss wife wanda who was charged with domestic abuse assault of her husband in    after gary lenius   died in march his democrat donor wife told several news outlets last month that both she and her husband had ingested a substance used to clean aquariums after hearing president donald trump tout one of its ingredients chloroquine phosphate from the white house briefing room  mainstream media jumped on the story using it to mock stupid trump supporters and promoting it as an example of how the president supposedly has blood on his hands  but is this the real story of what happened perhaps not at least according to the homicide division of the mesa city police department who are cautioning that the case is far from closed  freebeacon report detective teresa van galder the homicide detective handling the case for the mesa city police department confirmed that the investigation is ongoing but declined to provide additional details  as this is an active investigation i cannot go into any details at this time regarding the case van galder said the free beacon provided a recording of its interview last month with wanda lenius  news of the police probe comes after a series of free beacon stories raised questions about the portrayal of the couple in the initial nbc news report that vaulted the story onto the national stage  though that report and others suggested the couple mindlessly followed the presidents medical advice to disastrous results friends of gary lenius told the free beacon they were skeptical he would knowingly ingest fish tank treatment  rather they described lenius as a levelheaded retired engineer and recounted a troubled marital relationship that included a previous domestic assault charge against his wife of which she was ultimately found not guilty the free beacon also reported that wanda lenius was a democratic donor whose most recent contribution went to a pro science super pac  what bothers me about this is that gary was a very intelligent man a retired mechanical engineer who designed systems for john deere in waterloo iowa and i really cant see the scenario where gary would say yes please i would love to drink some of that koi fish tank cleaner one of his close friends told the free beacon it just doesnt make any sense  another source who asked that all identifying information be withheld told the free beacon earlier this month that wanda lenius would constantly berate gary in public everyone was embarrassed for him but he outwardly did not seem to care much  in our opinion their marriage was seen outwardly to be as one sided as a marriage possibly could be gary worshiped wanda this person said adding that his wife would routinely call him a doofus and humiliate him in public  wanda lenius was charged with domestic abuse assault in   after she allegedly hit her husband and swung a mounted birdhouse at him gary lenius declined to cooperate in the case testifying that he was not injured or placed in fear of injury his wife was exonerated  wanda lenius said in a phone interview with the free beacon last month that she and her husband had watched the president tout the virtues of chloroquine on the news citing preliminary studies that showed it may be a promising treatment for coronavirus  she remembered purchasing a container of chloroquine phosphate years before to clean a fish tank she said  the powder which can be lethal if ingested is sold by aquarium suppliers and used to treat viral outbreaks in large fish tanks she told the free beacon that she had mentioned this to her husband and he kind of laughed at me you know it was just a regular conversation  we werent big supporters of trump but we did see that they were using it in china and stuff she said and we just made a horrible tragic mistake  campaign finance records show that wanda lenius has given thousands of dollars to democratic groups and candidates over the past two years most recently to the   action fund the group bills itself as the pro science resistance and has criticized the trump administrations response to the coronavirus pandemic holding up the lenius case to slam the white house  in the same interview wanda lenius told the free beacon that her husband had been planning to schedule a doctors appointment to have a leg injury looked at and the couple worried he might pick up coronavirus at the clinic thats when she said she reached for the fish tank cleaner in her pantry her husbands response she said was is it still good  wanda lenius routinely prepared a vitamin cocktail for him according to gary leniuss friend  asked if she and gary lenius had a conversation about taking the chloroquine at that time she told the free beacon no i mean it was really kind of a spur of the moment thing adding that the couple ingested one teaspoon and some soda each at least four times the lethal limit

1,the united nations has awarded china a place on the un human rights council despite the communist nation recently covering up the true extent of the coronavirus epidemic in wuhan punishing whistleblowers with draconian penalties and costing the world precious time in preparing for the pandemic  delay and deceit over the origins of the coronavirus outbreak cost the world precious time  at the cost of many thousands of lives in the rest of the world  human rights activists also point out that china has a long record of the most serious human rights abuses and has no place lecturing the world about human rights from the pulpit at the united nations  jiang duan minister at the chinese mission in geneva has been appointed to the un human rights councils consultative group where he will serve as the representative of the asia pacific states  dailymail report the coronavirus outbreak originated in china late last year reportedly in the wet livestock markets in the city of wuhan  the country has recorded    deaths from coronavirus and    cases but many speculate that this number is much higher and that china is trying to cover up the true reality of the spread  but now jiang duan minister at the chinese mission in geneva has been appointed to the un human rights councils consultative group where he will serve as the representative of the asia pacific states  he will serve as one of five representatives for blocs of countries and is joined by delegates from spain slovenia and chad  a new us intelligence report leaked this week suggested the chinese communist party is still lying about the true number of cases and deaths it has led to an increasingly intense war of words between it and the us  the intelligence community handed over a classified report to the white house last week one of the officials told bloomberg news and the report concluded that chinas numbers are fake  speculation arose over chinas reporting after its government said earlier this month that there were no new cases in wuhan where the pandemic stemmed from and images of stacks of thousands of urns outside funeral homes in hubei province showed up  chinese president xi jinping second right visits the xixi national wetland park during an inspection in hangzhou in eastern chinas zhejiang province last week  there have also been questions surrounding chinas ever changing methodology for counting and reporting its coronavirus cases and deaths  for weeks the chinese government did not count asymptomatic individuals even if they tested positive  and only on tuesday added more than    asymptomatic cases to its total  observers experts and politicians have warned that china has lied and covered up key information during virtually every stage of its coronavirus response  from the initial outbreak to the number of cases and deaths and is still not telling the truth  beijing initially tried to cover up the virus by punishing medics who discovered it denying it could spread person to person and delaying a lockdown of affected regions  meaning early opportunities to control the spread were lost  then once the virus began spreading the communist party began censoring public information about it and spread disinformation overseas  including suggesting that us troops could have been the initial carriers  even now prominent politicians have warned that infection and death totals being reported by the regime are likely to be wrong  with locals in the epicenter of wuhan suggesting the true tolls could be ten times higher  but as other countries struggle to cope with the pandemic it has appeared to get on top of the crisis  unconstrained by considerations such as legality and privacy the authoritarian regime used and is still using mandatory quarantine and other draconian measures such as tracking individuals through their mobile phones infra red cameras to measure fever and facial recognition software to stop the pandemic in its tracks  the chinese communist party is strict in its rule  criticism is muffled at home by the great firewall of china which prevents    billion people receiving online information from the outside world communications between chinese people are monitored and censored those who speak out pay a fearsome price  there is also the terrible fate of the countrys muslim minority the uighurs of western china their historic culture has been obliterated with a million or more dispatched to mind control camps where they are forced to breach their religious customs  a doctor in the country also caught the publics attention after he was reprimanded by police and accused of spreading fake news for warning on social media of sars at a wuhan seafood market on december   lis post came two weeks before coronavirus broke out in the city of   million which has been locked down since january    li wenliang   later succumbed to the deadly contagion in the early hours of friday morning local time despite attempts to resuscitate him  earlier this year a leading campaign group said china is using its economic and diplomatic might to carry out the most intense attack ever on the global system for protecting human rights  human rights watch hrw made the allegation in its annual report launched at the united nations headquarters in new york two days after its executive director kenneth roth was barred from entering hong kong during his trip to release the study there  the ngo accused president xi jinpings government of overseeing the most brutal and pervasive oppression that china has seen for decades including building a nightmarish surveillance system in xinjiang province  to fend off global efforts to hold it to account beijing has significantly increased efforts to undermine the international institutions created in the mid  th century to defend human rights hrw said  beijing has long suppressed domestic critics now the chinese government is trying to extend that censorship to the rest of the world mr roth said in the   page report  if not challenged beijings actions portend a dystopian future in which no one is beyond the reach of chinese censors and an international human rights system so weakened that it no longer serves as a check on government repression he added  news of chinas position on the un human rights council comes as the country came to a standstill on saturday to mourn patients and medical staff killed by coronavirus as the worlds most populous country observed a nationwide three minute silence  officials said the observance was a chance to mourn virus martyrs  an honorific title bestowed by the government this week on   medical workers who died fighting the outbreak  at  am citizens paused cars trains and ships sounded their horns and air raid sirens rang out in memory  china came to a standstill on saturday to mourn patients and medical staff killed by the coronavirus as the worlds most populous country observed a nationwide three minute silence pictured people during the silence in wuhan  in wuhan  the city where the virus first emerged late last year  sirens and horns sounded as people fell silent in the streets  staff at the tongji hospital stood outside with heads bowed towards the main building some in the protective hazmat suits that have become a symbol of the crisis worldwide  xu a nurse at tongji who worked on the frontlines treating coronavirus patients said i hope they can rest well in heaven  workers in protective wear paused silently beside barriers at one residential community  a reminder that there are still tight restrictions on everyday life across wuhan  state media showed chinese president xi jinping and other officials standing outside a beijing government compound wearing white flowers  national flags were lowered to half mast across the country including in the capitals tiananmen square  pedestrians in one of the citys busiest shopping districts stopped walking and kept their heads low in silent tribute while police patrolling stood at the side of the road with their riot shields down and bowed heads  shopper wang yongna said during this process a lot of people including the medical workers have made extraordinary contributions they are all heroes  park goers paused their activities too some with hands together in prayer  trains on beijings subway network also came to a standstill  the hashtag china remembers its heroes racked up nearly    billion views on the twitter like weibo platform on saturday  the medics dubbed martyrs included doctor li wenliang a whistleblower in wuhan who was reprimanded by authorities for trying to warn others in the early days of the contagion  lis death from coronavirus in february prompted a national outpouring of grief and anger at the governments handling of the crisis  the ruling communist party has sought to direct criticism to local authorities in wuhan and surrounding hubei province who have been accused of downplaying the severity of the virus at first  despite drastic measures to lock down the province in late january the epidemic spiralled into a global pandemic with more than one million cases  some restrictions in hubei were eased in recent weeks after the officially stated number of new infections dropped to near zero  saturdays commemoration coincided with the annual qing ming holiday  the tomb sweeping festival  when chinese people visit the graves of relatives and leave offerings in remembrance  although china claims to have curbed the spread of the virus some restrictions were tightened again this week to prevent a second wave of infections  authorities have discouraged visits to cemeteries to mark the festival  last year nearly ten million people visited cemeteries across the three day holiday according to state news agency xinhua  at beijings enormous babaoshan cemetery mourners had to make an online reservation to visit a grave in a limited number of time slots with only three relatives allowed per tomb  nobody was going in or coming out of wuhans biandanshan cemetery saturday afternoon and security staff stood at the gate  some residents burned paper money on the streets friday the eve of the festival instead  a   year old wuhan resident with the surname li said we can only stay at home we cant go to the graves we can only remember our relatives at home  cemeteries across china are offering a cloud tomb sweeping service in which families can honour their ancestors by watching a live stream of cemetery staff attending to graves on their behalf  websites are also offering people the chance to pay their respects at a virtual tomb including by lighting a digital candle and leaving a dish of digital fruit  china today reported one new confirmed case in wuhan and   among people arriving from abroad along with four new deaths all in wuhan  china now has recorded a total of    cases and    deaths although those figures are generally considered to be understated because of a lack of testing and a reluctance to report the scale of the original outbreak

incarnation lives on july   der spiegel headlined snowden claims nsa ties put german intelligence in tight spot theyre in bed together said snowden nsa partners with foreign intelligence in other countries its foreign affairs directorate bnd does so its done in ways to insulate their political leaders from the backlash its precautionary in case people learn how grievously theyre violating global privacy bndnsa cooperation is far greater than previously known according to der spiegel nsa provides analysis tools theyre for bnds signals monitoring of foreign data streams that travel through germany besides other areas bnd focuses on the middle east route through which data packets from crisis regions travel der spiegel said bnd pulls data from five different nodes that are then analyzed at the foreign intelligence services headquarters in pullach near munich gerhard schindler heads it he confirmed the partnership during a meeting with members of the german parliaments control committee for intelligence issues germanys federal office for the protection of the constitution is responsible for counterintelligence its investigating whether nsa gained access to internet traffic traveling through germany berlin approved construction of a new us army base in germany nsa plans operations there when completed a new wiesbaden based consolidated intelligence center is being built us contractors are doing so supposedly itll be bug proof it may not turn out that way snowden told der spiegel that german outrage over nsa spying was pretense both countries work closely together relations are longstanding current operations far exceed stasis theyre conducted with technological ease decades earlier spying was crude compared to todays modern methods operate in unprecedented ways virtually everyone can be monitored everywhere at all times nearly everything about targets is known almost nothings too secret to escape scrutiny theres no way to hide theres no place to do it more than bnd is involved snowden provided new details about britains government communications headquarters gchq its tempora system is the signal intelligence communitys first full take internet buffer it accumulates and saves all data passing through britain the scope of this full take system is vast according to snowden it snarfs everything in a rolling buffer to allow retroactive investigation without missing a single bit as a general rule so long as you have any choice at all you should never route through or peer with the uk under any circumstances he stressed german internet experts said doing so isnearly impossible snowden stressed the importance of meta data collection and retention authorities having it know who communicated with whom when and about what they can sift through information for whats most important meta data said snowden tells them what they actually want it provides tips on which communications and content might be most relevant simple pointing and clicking lets them retrieve or permanently collect the full content of communications that have already been stored for a specific person or group or they can collect future communications anyone can be selected for targeting based on for example your facebook or webmail content britain germany and most other western countries are longstanding nsa partners said snowden angela merkel alluding to cold war tactics doesnt wash der spiegel said nsa monitors about     million german phone calls daily on average it collects information on   million internet data sets der spiegel interviewed snowden earlier he was in hawaii he hadnt left for hong kong he communicated by encrypted emails it was done with documentary filmmaker laura poitras and computer security researcherhacker jacob applebaum information snowden provided showed some allies exceed nsas zeal for gathering data britains gchq spying is notorious intelligence sources call it a full take operation it sucks up all information no matter where it comes from and which laws are broken said snowden if you send a data packet through britain well get it if you download anything and the server is in britain well get it if the nsa is ordered to target an individual it virtually take over that persons data so the targets computer no longer belongs to him it more or less belongs to the us government der spiegels interview with snowden as explained above it was conducted from hawaii it was before snowden revealed germanys longstanding cooperation with nsa question what is the mission of the national security agency nsa and how is their job in accordance with the law snowden it is the mission of the nsa to be aware of anything of importance going on outside of the united states this is a considerable task and the people there are convinced that not knowing everything about everyone could lead to some existential crisis so at some point you believe its all right to bend the rules a little then if people hate it that you can bend the rules it suddenly becomes vital even to break them question are german authorities or politicians involved in the monitoring system snowden yes of course nsa officials are in cahoots with the germans as well as with the most other western countries us intelligence operatives warn the others when someone we want to catch uses one of their airports and they then deliver them to us the information on this we can for example pull off of the monitored mobile phone of a suspected hackers girlfriend who used it in an entirely different country which has nothing to do with the case the other authorities do not ask us where we got the leads and we do not ask them anything either that way they can protect their political staff from any backlash if it came out how massive the global violation of peoples privacy is question but now as details of this system are revealed who will be brought before a court over this snowden before us courts youre not serious are you when the last large wiretapping scandal was investigated the interception without a court order which concerned millions of communications that should really have led to the longest prison sentences in world history however then our highest representatives simply stopped the investigation the question who is to be accused is theoretical if the laws themselves are not respected laws are meant for people like you or me but not for them question does the nsa cooperate with other states like israel snowden yes all the time the nsa has a large section for that called the fad foreign affairs directorate question did the nsa help to write the stuxnet program its malware contamination used to infect irans bushehr nuclear facility snowden the nsa and israel wrote stuxnet together question what are the major monitoring programs active today and how do international partners help the nsa snowden the partners in the five eyes meaning other us intelligence operations uk australian new zealand and canadian spying sometimes go even further than the nsa people themselves take the tempora program of the british intelligence gchq for instance tempora is the first full take i save everything approach in the intelligence world it sucks in all data no matter what it is and which rights are violated by it this buffered storage allows for subsequent monitoring not a single bit escapes right now the system is capable of saving three days worth of traffic but that will be optimized three days may perhaps not sound like a lot but its not just about connection metadata full take means that the system saves everything if you send a data packet and if makes its way through the uk we will get it if you download anything and the server is in the uk then we get it and if the data about your sick daughter is processed through a london call center then oh i think you have understood question can anyone escape snowden well if you had the choice you should never send information over british lines or british servers even the queens selfies with her lifeguards would be recorded if they existed question do the nsa and its partners apply some kind of wide dragnet method to intercept phone calls texts and data snowden yes but how much they can record depends on the capabilities of the respective taps some data is held to be more worthwhile and can therefore be recorded more frequently but all this is rather a problem with foreign tapping nodes less with those of the us this makes the monitoring in their own territory so terrifying the nsas options are practically limitless in terms of computing power space or cooling capacity for the computers question the nsa is building a new data center in utah what is it for snowden these are the new mass data storage facilities question for how long will the information there be stored snowden right now it is still so that the full text of collected material ages very quickly within a few days especially given its enormous amount unless an analyst marked a target or a particular communication in that case the communication is saved for all eternity one always get an authorization for that anyway the metadata ages less quickly the nsa at least wants all metadata to be stored forever often the metadata is more valuable than the contents of the communication because in most cases one can retrieve the content if there is metadata and if not you mark all future communications that fits this metadata and is of interest so that henceforth it will be recorded completely the metadata tells you what you actually want from the broader stream question do private companies help the nsa snowden yes but its hard to prove that the names of the cooperating telecom companies are the crown jewels of the nsa generally you can say that multinationals with headquarters in the usa should not be trusted until they prove otherwise this is unfortunate because these companies have the ability to deliver the worlds best and most reliable services if they wanted to to facilitate this civil rights movements should now use these revelations as a driving force the companies should write enforceable clauses into their terms guaranteeing their clients that they are not being spied on and they should include technical guarantees if you could move even a single company to do such a thing it would improve the security of global communications and when this appears to not be feasible you should consider starting one such company yourself question are there companies that refuse to cooperate with the nsa snowden yes but i know nothing of a corresponding list that would prove this however there would surely be fewer companies of this type if the companies working with the nsa would be punished by the customer that should be the highest priority of all computer users who believe in the freedom of thoughts question what are the sites you should beware if you do not want to become targeted by the nsa snowden normally one is marked as a target because of a facebook profile or because of your emails the only place which i personally know where you can become a target without this specific labeling are jihadist forums question what happens if the nsa has a user in its sights snowden the target person is completely monitored an analyst will get a daily report about what has changed in the computer system of the targeted person there will also bepackages with certain data which the automatic analysis systems have not understood and so on the analyst can then decide what he wants to do the computer of the target person does not belong to them anymore it then more or less belongs to the us government a final comment venezuela granted snowden asylum bolivia and nicaragua suggest doing so his time in moscows sheremetyevo airports transit area may be near ending venezuela awaits word on his plans its offer remains firm perhaps snowden prefers communicating privately his safety depends on doing so hell explain when and if its wise hopefully hell relocate safely quickly millions support his courage he risked everything to expose lawless us spying he

2,breaking isis terrorist survivor admits something shocking according to recent reports an isis jihadist recently made the decision to convert to christianity after being left for dead on the eastern border of syria the man was rescue by christian missionaries from the region and survived he had been involved in a confrontation between isis and syrian army forces reportedly missionaries from saint dominican catholic presbytery of ayyash decided to give the man a proper christian burial they carried him several miles before he came back to life priest hermann groschlins account of the incident is below as originally told by the aleppo herald he told me that he was always taught that to die as a martyr would open him the gates of jannah or gates of heaven yet as he had started to ascend towards the light of the heavens devilish entities or jinns he called them appeared and led him to the fiery pits of hell there he had to relive all the pain he had inflicted upon others and every death he had caused throughout his entire life he even had to relive the decapitations of his victims through their own eyes then god spoke unto him and told him that he had failed miserably as a human soul that he would be banned from the gates of heaven if he chose to die but that if he chose to live again he would have another chance to repent his sins and walk along gods path once again the priest reports that the man claims he was brought back to life moments later eventually he made the decision to convert to christianity
1,one trick of the original mccarthyism from the old cold war was to take some innocuous or accurate comment from a leader in moscow  saying something like poverty is a cruel side of capitalism or racism persists in the us and to claim that some american reformer who says much the same thing must be a kremlin tool   now in the new cold war we are seeing a similar trend in the way some democrats and the mainstream us media are citing accurate assessments from russian president vladimir putin and claiming that republican presidential nominee donald trump is somehow in league with putin for observing the same realities russian president vladimir putin following his address to the un general assembly on sept     un photo   a case in point is tuesdays editorial in the washington post entitled the putin trump worldview in print and trump and putin share a frightening worldview online the editorial quotes putin as observing that mr trump represents the interests of the sizable part of american society that is tired of the elites that have been in power for decades now  and does not like to see power handed down by inheritance   the posts editorial writers then snidely note that mr putin and mr trump have an uncanny way of echoing each others words   but that is a classic example of mccarthyistic sophistry just because some demonized figure like putin says something that is undeniably true and an american sees the same facts doesnt make that american a putin puppet or a moscow stooge or any of the other ugly names now being hurled at people who wont join in todays trendy russia bashing and guilt by association   putin is not wrong that many of trumps supporters  along with many americans who backed sen bernie sanders  are tired of the elites that have behaved arrogantly and stupidly for decades many americans also dont believe that a familys name should decide who becomes the leader of the united states whether that be the bushes or the clintons   indeed what putin is saying amounts to almost a truism yet here is the washington post not only suggesting that because putin is saying something that it must be false but then smearing trump or anyone else who detects the same reality   double standards   the same post editorial also goes to great lengths to reject any comparisons between the russian and syrian government airstrikes on the syrian neighborhoods of east aleppo  to root out al qaeda connected jihadists and their supposedly moderate rebel allies  and us and iraqi government airstrikes on the iraqi city of mosul under the control of al qaedas spinoff group the islamic state

4,massey punched play on a cd containing portions of   beatles songs as they sounded on the   cds that brought the fab fours catalog into the digital age then played spruced up cd remasters the world will hear when theyre released sept   across town in santa monica a few weeks later three representatives were demoing mtv networks the beatles rock band video game two reps strapped on replicas of paul mccartneys hofner bass and john lennons rickenbacker guitar while the third sat behind an electronic drum kit emulating ringo starrs ludwig set and delved into the new video game which not coincidentally hits the market the same day as the new cds even though nearly   years have elapsed since the beatles acrimonious breakup the harmony they created on record in concert and on film maintains a remarkable hold on pop music lovers worldwide the two projects promise to ramp up beatlemania again for yet another generation the beatles recorded past is being faithfully refurbished in cds while the video game springboards the british group into the world of interactive game play and the entertainment future retailers have been taking advance orders for individual cds box sets the and rock band game for months and its a good bet that the beatles will appear near the top of sales charts one more time emi is shipping some   million cds worldwide about half to the us according to a recent billboard report with first week sales in the us expected to total around    copies the beatles have never fully slipped from the public consciousness helped along by carefully considered new projects the groups albums have sold nearly   million copies in the years since nielsen soundscan began tracking retail sales in   the remastered cds and the rock band game along with a beatles edition of trivial pursuit and several other related products are a coordinated effort to reinvigorate the franchise adding to the momentum is the recent news that director robert zemeckis is negotiating to make a new version of the beatles   animated film yellow submarine the beatles rock band video game with a list price of   introduces the worlds best selling pop group to the world of interactive gaming that world has been dominated by young male enthusiasts but its drawing in their parents and grandparents classic rock pop and country material has been included in rock band which was developed by mtvs game producer harmonix based in cambridge mass what the remastered beatles cds offer beyond the opportunity for emi and capitol to pump up profits    theyre being issued as individual cds and in two box sets one with all the mono mixes   the other with the stereo versions      is a fresh take on music thats been omnipresent for nearly a half century the box of mono releases is considered the definitive record of their music because the group and their producer george martin created everything through the beatles aka the white album in   to be heard in mono stereo mixes of those recordings were typically created as an afterthought and the beatles often werent present when those versions were done the fab fours recorded output spanned just seven years and   studio albums those albums document the beatles transformation from a group of lads bashing out their versions of american rb and rock tunes into pops most successful and influential songwriting team as well as one of its most accomplished teams of recording studio innovators rouse who has overseen remastering the monaural mixes that the group preferred and massey who is in charge of remastering the stereo versions have been working on beatles projects for a dozen years or more they have earned the support of surviving beatles members mccartney and starr as well as yoko ono and olivia harrison the widows of john lennon and george harrison who took over their husbands interests in apple corps the company the beatles launched in   to control their business affairs apple still approves all beatles projects and the four principals are referred to as the shareholders by those working on projects they trust this team said apple chief jeff jones during the remaster preview in june theyve been doing this for a long time rouse displayed an engineers pride when describing the pristine state of the original beatles tapes some of them nearly   years old these tapes hadnt been played in   years said rouse we would never consider using anything other than first generation masters  these were done one track at a time not album by album the results in general everything is cleaner and fuller and the dynamic range    the difference between the loudest and softest sounds    has been expanded vocals sound more immediate the old twist and shout is almost tinny next to the remastered version mccartneys fingers plucking the strings of his acoustic guitar as he sings yesterday become more tangibly percussive his voice and the guitar more open harrisons taxman benefits from the visceral punch of starrs drums its less dramatic than improvements in the love soundtrack for which beatles producer martin and his son giles martin remixed the original tapes for the cirque du soleil show in las vegas that george harrison dreamed up with cirque creator guy laliberte as a creative collaboration among the surviving beatles and their families giles martin also produced the remixed tracks used in the beatles rock band and harrisons singer guitarist son dhani lent a hand to formulating the game mastering is very limited you can only do so much rouse acknowledged its a much more subtle approach as opposed to remixing its also being presented at less than its full sonic potential because of the inherent limitations of the compact disc neil young by comparison just issued archives vol   a   disc retrospective set on blu ray disc in addition to cd and dvd versions cds can hold only   percent to   percent of the digital information in masters that use the current state of the art  khz   bit sampling rate the same used for the beatles new masters according to rouse a blu ray disc offers   percent of that sampling rate for playback you can change it into a video game and make it cute and everything young said about the beatles remasters hes concerned that the music itself will be slighted unless rouse and his team go back to the original masters and remaster them the right way and give all the information about them  thats what people want an emi uk marketing executive said there are no plans to issue the beatles remasters on blu ray adding however that its just a matter of when not if theyll be released in audiophile vinyl pressings and apple still hasnt reached a deal to make the quartets catalog available for legal downloading mccartney starr and martin have said in recent years that outside of a unique project like love they arent interested in completely rethinking what they created in a bygone place and time a different aesthetic is at work in the beatles rock band which takes history as a launching point the biggest priority for all of us was to ensure we were creating a product that accurately captured the essence of the beatles said harmonix chief executive and co founder alex rigopulos  the shareholders were all generous enough with their time to provide this guidance in abundance he said this included everything from helping to select the track list to helping shape the visual design and representation of the band to helping craft the historical narrative the game came out far better as a result than it possibly could have if they hadnt been involved the game uses   songs from among some   in the official beatles oeuvre to create play through distinctly different eras for giles martin one hurdle was to fabricate the equivalent of multitrack recordings required for rock band to work he needed to isolate individual instruments and voices from two track tapes of the beatles earliest works on which all instruments were combined on one channel all voices in the second we worked out a way for filtering the different parts    the bass and drum tracks leaving out the guitar martin said i was completely surprised about what we managed to achieve when my dad came to see me and check out our work he said what youve done is alchemy its like you handing me a cake and me handing you back the ingredients the whole idea he said was to have a game that is collaborative something generations can play together  therefore we wanted to choose songs that could be multiplayer that knocked out something like yesterday  we didnt want to veer into one player songs songs are set amid several environments starting with the bands scruffy days as leather jacketed rockers playing the cavern club in their hometown of liverpool through the swan song   concert atop apple corps headquarters in london avatars of each band member change through the years from the collarless suits of the ed sullivan show appearances through the psychedelic military uniforms of sgt peppers lonely hearts club band the beatles decision to stop touring after   to focus on the recording studio presented a limitation that the games developers at harmonix solved by inventing dreamscapes for later songs these are colorful backdrops such as a verdant field for harrisons here comes the sun or a gazebo that turns into a hot air balloon in the title track from sgt pepper giles martin also incorporated previously unreleased studio chatter among the beatles in many of the songs rock band creators didnt consider it sacrilege to tinker with history the visuals for birthday for instance show all four beatles at their usual instrument assignments even though starr had left the band briefly when that song was recorded and mccartney actually played drums we took some liberties said sean baptiste manager of community development for harmonix it is a game after all optional add end at one point harmonixs project leader josh randall said it hit him that these guys dont feel like the beatles to me something was missing i went back and scrutinized all the footage wed been looking at for the previous year thats when i started to realize that when these guys play theres so much joy that just pours out of them how do we do that the answer the creation of new game coding to that would allow animators more freedom with facial expressions we pushed as hard as we could to try to capture a little bit of that spark

4,we were expecting people to watch a lot of tv said dr mathias basner of the university of pennsylvania school of medicines department of psychiatry one of the studys authors but said basner it was astonishing to learn that even when they had to get up early for work americans were unlikely to pare their habit of nighttime tv on average americans spent almost half of their last two waking hours of each day watching the tube in spite of technologies that allow us viewers to record and watch a show later or on hand held devices they just wait till the show ends to turn off the tube and go to sleep said basner interestingly he noted those who live in the mountain or central time zones where prime time is an hour earlier than on the coasts get more sleep than those who live in the eastern or pacific time zones the study findings were drawn from time logs kept by    americans for the us bureau of labor statistics between   and   the research was presented this week at sleep   the  rd annual meeting of the associated professional sleep societies in seattle roughly   percent of american adults sleep less than seven to eight hours even though doing so raises their risk of daytime sleepiness obesity illness and even death basner and his colleagues have been exploring where americans could wedge more shut eye into their days and they looked at the two hours before bedtime and the two hours after waking as the best places to add some zs but lengthening commutes and workdays have made a delay in workers start times unlikely basner said so if americans are going to close their yawning sleep gap theyll need to do so either by leaving the tv off at days end or taking the bold step of turning it off in the middle of the show theyve tuned in
3,cop with smoking gun brags awesome after blasting pet dogamanda warren on that day cali escaped the backyard fence and a neighbor called animal control to retrieve the dog unfortunately officer woolly arrived first you might be aghast when you hear what woolly said when he bragged and laughed about shooting a dog that was just standing there and then bragged again about another shooting then there is his murderous past and what he told the animal control officer to do next when officers arrived someone told them that animal control was on the way according to a witness officer brice woolley said im not waiting for animal control he went to his car got his shotgun did the deed and then bragged to animal control about how awesome it looked when the collar flew off her neck specifically did you see her collar fly off when i shot her that was awesome as he laughed he went on to brag about a dog he shot two days earlier with a pistol when animal control arrived who work for the department woolly is quoted as saying we will just write up the report as she was attacking you and other neighbors and blah blah blah meaning blah blah blah as in business as usual but cali didnt attack according to witnesses she certainly didnt pose a threat to the officer who had time to walk to his car obtain his shotgun walk back and shoot her directly in the neck presumably at close range when calis owner sarah arrived holding her   month old infant the officer said shes dead i just shot her after finding out sarah broke down and cried and walked back into her house without looking at witness evidence the department simply told sarah the officers were in their right when they shot her dog after she went to the office to complain officer brice woolly has shot and killed a person while working at a previous oklahoma departmentin tishomingo the city had to reach a settlement and let woolly goyou can see footage and description here it was someone who took too long to stop and then ran woolly was caught lying about the account when the testimony did not match the timing and footage of the dashcam somehow he made it to ardmore department even after failing psychological exams and has killed at least two dogs warning graphic images appear below i am posting these pictures because the owner has posted them publicly to raise awareness of officers gratuitously shooting innocent dogs not many of us see the brutal reality of pet owners having to deal with their dead friends in the yard or on the neighborhood street after an officer casually walks away from the gore the shotgun wound appears to be very close range other similar disturbing instances aside from the hundreds and hundreds of pets who get shot by police each year over   one year in chicago alone and milwaukee include the following   police are using live injured animals for target practice for real if you dont know about this yet you need to please drop everything and go here and   a cop shot a mildly injured deer in front of a child when the family tried to take it to a rescue center he threatened them with force and arrest for even suggesting that they could help as you can see from that story the same exact police tactics are being simultaneously deployed both in the us and canada it didnt just happen and its not due to lack of training it is meant to cause trauma and shutdown especially when there is no threat from the dog to the officer to date no on duty officers have been killed by dogs this unnecessary andunequivocally psychopathic behavior is important to know about for awareness and safety think twice before calling    when it comes to pets talk to your neighbor first as it happens the neighbor called animal control which is a part of their police department how could anyone have known that this would happen to cali the family is not letting this killing go unheard to be sure their petition isnt typical it goes to both ardmore police department and oklahomas governor new facebook page justice for cali ardmore police departmenthttpwwwardmorepdorg recent other articles by amanda warren and then this cop shot an unarmed person perhaps if his callousness in shooting an innocent dog hadnt been dismissed and overlooked the later tragedy of his murder of a human being would never have happened

2,you wont believe what obama just said about the bible you will be sick for someone who claims to be a christian president obama is sure quick to criticize the bible and the very foundation of the religion perhaps more disturbing is his willingness to discount the constitution and declaration of independence as president of the united states according to recent reports obama believes all three of these texts are ridden with sexism the defense department recently approved a sexism course which talks about how these three documents contribute to modern sexism the course teaches that these historical documents are actually historical influences that allow sexism to continue the presentation as built by the defense equal opportunity management institution the presentation goes on to point to several quotes from the bible the reference to all men in the declaration of independence and the idea that the constitution did not cover the rights of slaves and women until later in history what do you think of the course is it an insult to our heritage

3,ovarian cancer what we think we know may harm ussayer ji ovarian cancer strikes fear into the hearts of women their families and their doctors alike risks of false positive diagnosis leading to a treatment that has been demonstrated to result in the worst outcomes of any gynecologic cancer have led the us preventive services task force uspstf to recommend against routine screening  the real tragedy largely still unacknowledged is that ovarian cancer statistics are not transparent to the fact that five times more women without ovarian cancer end up having surgery than those with ovarian cancer according to a   jama retrospective study of ovarian cancer screening  the jama trial of    women found that those in the intervention group who underwent annual screening for ovarian cancer    evaluating serum cancer antigen ca   for   years and transvaginal ultrasound for   years were far more likely to receive a false positive diagnosis    women than an accurate positive cancer diagnosis   women    percent of the false positives    women opted for oophorectomy surgery surgical removal of one or both ovaries a fact that can not fully convey the untold suffering morbidity and decrease in lifespan they experienced as a result of these medical mistakes for instance we know from breast cancer research that even when women receive false positive diagnoses that are soon followed by corrective cancer free diagnoses the negative psychosocial outcomes of the shock of false diagnosis persist for at least   years see hidden dangers of mammograms that every woman should know presumably family history and so called brca gene status are the best method to determine your risk and today with high profile figures like angelina jolie removing her breasts and soon her ovaries due to what she is being told is her extremely elevated risk associated with her family history and brca status millions around the world are now looking at jolies decision as a viable method to take back control of their health vis  vis cancer the orwellian result prevention is being equated with the removal of non diseased organs but are brca mutations technically brca single nucleotide polymorphisms snps of which there are hundreds  really the primary drivers of ovarian cancer risk is being born with bad genes and having close family members with a history of gynecological cancer alone enough to make an informed choice the answer is a resounding no brca mutation status is only one factor to consider every man and woman has the brca  and   genes within their genome and regardless of whether they were born with a variant that renders the cancer protective brca protein dysfunctional or inactive ie germline mutations or came to acquire it later in life as a result of genetic processes we do not fully understand ie somatic mutation brca genes in susceptible tissues eg breast ovary prostate can be deactivated through factors beyond the control of the genes epigenetic factors such as through viral infection sv    epstein barr virus  chemical exposures  nutritional factors   and even mind body processes  that have downstream physiological effects that directly modulate the structure and function of our genome and epigenome in fact whether a brca gene is rendered dysfunctional through an inborn mutation or from the outside in through the silencing of the gene hypermethylation of the promote region of the gene the result is the same as far as the cell phenotype and brca protein production is concerned this means that risk can not be calculated accurately without taking into account both genetic and epigenetic factors with the crucial difference being that epigenetic changes to brca such as hypermethylation of the gene is at least theoretically partially reversible andor preventable through behavioral nutritional environmental and lifestyle changes there is a prevailing belief in conventional medicine and among the lay public today that if you possess a brca  mutation you are fated to develop cancer but inborn or developed brca  variations are so complex with literally hundreds identified that there are few studies that have even attempted to identify and validate the risk associated with each variant bunched together under the umbrella concept of a brca gene mutation the reality is that anyone can develop brca  or brca  dysfunction in their lifetime through chemical and infectious exposures and nutritional incompatibilities and deficiencies such that the resulting gene silenting effect methylation is the same the brca genes are altered within the cells producing changes consistent with the appearance of pathology in a screen detected lesion or tumor indeed a recent study published in tumour biology found that brca  gene silencing through promoter region hypermethylation were frequent events in ovarian cancer the frequency of brca  gene silencing in epithelial ovarian carcinoma eoc was    and   in low malignant potential tumors lmp they found that brca  protein expression remember brca proteins protect against dna damage and tumor initiation and promotion was significantly lower in eocs and that the lack of protein expression correlated with tumor grade and type and the methylation status correlated with reduced brca  expression remarkably they found that benign tumors and normal ovarian tissue showed no methylation of the brca  gene indicating that epigenetic methylation as opposed to inherited gene defects is also a primary driver of ovarian cancer malignancy clearly this indicates that factors outside the primary dna sequences that constitute the brca genes themselves play a vitally important role in determining if these genes function correctly this shifts the focus to the avoidable causes of brca gene silencing indicating that cancer risk is not a juggernaut force of lethality buried within the destiny of genes rather that we have a hand to play in the process furthermore the published literature shows that having a brca brca  mutation actually confers improved survival from ovarian cancer a recent meta analysis found that of   evaluable studies   identifiedbrcadysfunction status as a favorable prognostic factor  the commonly agreed upon explanation for this counterintuitive finding is that platinum based chemotherapy is more effective against ovarian cancer cells that have dysfunctional dna repair mechanisms associated with a brca mutation the problem however is that the class of chemotherapy compounds that exert genotoxicity as their primarily mechanism of action also result in widespread collateral damage to healthy tissue as well as enriching the chemoresistant cancer stem cell subpopulation within a tumor leading to in increase in the malignancy of the cancer tissue that can not be de bulkeddestroyed the result of which is the recurrence of more aggressive life threatening cancers despite the slight improvement in survival offered initially from the treatment stage   ovarian cancer only has a   year survival rate of   while not yet sufficiently explored relatively non toxic botanical extracts such as curcumin resveratrol and green tea and several dozen others including frankincense exert anti ovarian cancer properties while often exhibiting the property of selective cytoxicity targeting ovarian cancer cells for epigenetic modifications leading to arrest of the cell cycle and cell death without harming non cancerous cells it is possible that brca dysfunction therefore may also respond exceptionally well to plant based therapies putting a different spin on the prevalent breast and ovarian cancer gene meme and perhaps conferring a survival advantage if only researchers would make effectiveness and safety a priority over developing proprietary formulations that are eligible for patent approval see why the law forbids the medicinal use of natural substances clearly given these considerations we must move beyond the fatalistic breast cancer or ovarian cancer gene brca memeplex and recognize the factors that we can control are at least as important as those we cannot ie germline dna sequences for instance we know that not only can certain petrochemicals knock out brca gene function but certain natural food components like reseveratrol found in grapes and peanuts can protect the brca gene against this exposure for a detailed explanation of this research read our article beyond the breast cancer gene brca why food is your medicine medical science is going through massive internal shifts today still trying to catch up almost a decade later to the fact that we are in the post genomic era and the sequencing of genes themselves will not produce the much anticipated holy grail of molecular biology and by implication radical improvements in the cure of disease we as a society are being forced to consider the vital importance of our lifestyle in the complexity of modern chronic

4,the ministry of economic affairs moea said wednesday that it is not necessary to adopt measures that will contravene a protocol signed between taiwan and united states on the easing of us beef imports economic affairs minister shih yen shiang said the ministry does not want to see taiwan us relations plunge into tension  pointing out that this would have a negative impact on the normal development of taiwan us trade ties shihs remarks came as the ruling and opposition parties prepared for a dec   showdown over the issue the dpp has proposed its version of an amendment to the act governing food sanitation relating to us beef imports which categorically prohibits imports of products such as offal ground beef spinal cords brains and skulls in order to bar beef imports at the source and at the countrys borders the ruling kuomintang kmt legislative caucus has said it will seek an emergency consensus with the administration prior to dec   on how a kmt  version amendment should be presented shih said the protocol signed recently with the united states on lifting a partial ban on imports of us beef has taken into consideration public health and international regulations which he described as a reasonable arrangement to assuage misgivings about the expanded us beef imports which include products such as ground beef and beef offal that some fear could be potentially tainted with bovine spongiform encephalopathy or mad cow disease the department of health doh has also imposed stringent measures    the so called three controls and five certificates he added the three controls refers to setting controls on beef imports at the source at borders and in markets while the five certificates refers to verifying certification documents checking that shipments are marked with detailed product information opening a high percentage of cartons of imported beef to check the product conducting food safety tests and being able to get information on suspected problem products immediately according to doh officials the measures have been effective and the public misgivings about the high risk parts of us beef coming to taiwan have proved unfounded he added vice economic affairs minister francis liang said washington is concerned about the moves by taiwans legislature to ban the imports which would run counter to the rules of the world health organization and world organization for animal health the us side is evaluating how taiwan tackles the issues he added

1,in a pitch to suspend the nations syrian refugee program  donald trump said minnesotans have suffered enough from accepting somali immigrants into their state  here in minnesota you have seen firsthand the problems caused with faulty refugee vetting with large numbers of somali refugees coming into your state without your knowledge without your support or approval trump said at a minneapolis rally sunday afternoon  he said his administration would suspend the syrian refugee program and not resettle refugees anywhere in the united states without support from the communities while hillary clintons plan will import generations of terrorism extremism and radicalism into your schools and throughout your communities
1,america is a nation of freedom loving patriots who will rise up against excessive restrictions including lockdowns and curfews says conservative actor chuck norris who published an op ed on monday wondering how long it will be until we are under martial law  the actor said he believes in being prudent and also being peaceful in the face of the covid   pandemic but he added he had tough questions to ask  norris said he was concerned by authoritarian lockdown orders and curfews being enforced that limit citizens rights  if the need for citizen confinement grows and the restrictions increase where does it end and what excessive burden are we then placing upon law enforcement to corral even half of americans   million he asked  and if even the smallest transgression of confinement restrictions ends up being a misdemeanor how will officials handle tens of millions of them  norris pointed out that if police are expected to enforce the curfews they too could become ill with coronavirus  and if that were to happen not only would the hospitals be full of police officers but there would also be fewer people left to enforce the increasingly dangerous lockdown  but what is even more frightening as norris stated is that if the lockdown lasts for five weeks or longer citizens could rise up and fight the system that is oppressing them  how long can we allow americans who are a freedom loving people and patriots to be under lockdown in their own homes without working norris asked  many scientists and specialists are even now calling the federal government to a five week national lockdown do we expect the majority to simply comply will they have the resources and wherewithal to go the distance without resistance  westernjournal reports these are frightening questions but the fact is that american citizens are used to being free and they are now being subjected to draconian restrictions on their liberties  state governments have taken control of the lives of millions of people telling us where we are allowed to go what time we have to be home and whose jobs are essential to the state  normally taking that kind of control of a nation would take a war but no one fired a shot and we handed over all of our rights  virginia gov ralph northam who you may remember from his promotion of ninth month abortions or his blackface scandal has closed churches in his state  is there any american freedom more fundamental than the right to worship when and where we want to  no one is saying that some restrictions are not needed but to many it appears we have given the government too much power too quickly  americans are playing along for now but the question is how much longer are they going to allow these infringements to stand  and is the government going to give all of our rights back after the nations mayors and governors have spent a month acting as kings  that should never be a question we have to ask in america  but it may be the most important one

3,the government of mars is already being planned a glimpse at martian lawby james holbrooks as far back as   outlined in theus national space policy and then given the budgetary green light by thenasa authorization act the united states has advanced the idea that americans could be living on mars by the  s a major milestone toward this end would be streamlining the ability to land human beings on an asteroid which the space agency hopes to accomplish by   this is around the same time that mars one the netherlands based nonprofit research group whose stated goal is to establish a human colony on mars by   is slated to start rocketing the hardware needed to construct and maintain said colony in the red planets direction a habitable settlement will await the first crew before they depart earth mars one says in itsmission statement the hardware needed will be sent to mars in the years ahead of the humans this unmanned mission is currently scheduled for   elon musk the multi billionaire ceo of tesla motors and private aerospace manufacturer spacex and the man whosetimetable for putting humans on mars beats even that of mars one has long seen the colonization of the red planet as a means to save the species i think there is a strong humanitarian argument for making life multi planetary musktold aeon magazine when asked why we should focus on mars when there are so many problems facing people here on earth in order to safeguard the existence of humanity in the event that something catastrophic were to happen in which case being poor or having a disease would be irrelevant because humanity would be extinct even amazon ceo jeff bezos whose private aerospace company blue origin is focused primarily on moving heavy industry from earth to outer spacesays we absolutely should and will colonize mars because its cool but as more and more time energy and capital are devoted to establishing a human presence on mars many are asking how the body governing such a colony will function one research group in seattle the blue marble space institute of science has recently penned areport addressing that very question the report titled a pragmatic approach to sovereignty on mars and published in space policy borrows from three already established treaties the antarctic treaty system ats the outer space treaty ost and the united nations convention on the law of the sea unclos using  s outer space treaty as a foundation the researchers targeted the potential problems that could arise as citizens from different countries begin to cohabitate on a new planet namely how much power should a central governing structure possess how to handle the inevitable disputes that will arise and how resource rights should be allocated and protected the governing body proposed by the blue marble institute is called the mars secretariat as the name implies this body would be a weak central authority whose purview would primarily be administrative record maintenance secretarial duties and the like martian inhabitants themselves would wield significant local power legally however this power would be derived from inhabitants host nations with conflicts to be resolved diplomatically or through a temporary tribunal system composed of representatives of other mars colonies as for resources the report proposes for the early days of colonization anyway that claims be limited to around   km parcels of land colonists within that zone would have all economic rights to the resources in that parcel though they would have no authority to prevent others from landing or even building habitats within that border the right of peaceful passage through exclusive economic zones ispatterned after unclos the report states which also restricts the degree of control that a colony can exert over the zone in which it operates the ost states that the exploration and use of outer space shall be carried out for the benefit and in the interests of all countries and shall be the province of all mankind to this end the report further proposes the establishment of planetary parks and a mars tax the parks would be preserved tracts of unclaimed land set aside for scientific and cultural use by all nations the tax would be applied for the right to extract mars resources with the revenue being distributed to countries back home on earth but eventually assuming everything goes to plan the stage will be reached in the future whereby inhabitants of the red planet will begin thinking of themselves as martians as opposed to colonists from earth and at that point how much of any cobbled together governing structure can those folks be expected to live by none says political scientistmichael byers from the university of british columbia in short he wrote in a januaryarticle for the washington post a mars colony would be entitled to independence if the majority of colonists made this desire clear through a referendum citing the   international covenant on civil and political rights whichestablished self determination as a basic human right byers concluded that human rights are universal they apply to every human being on this planet and elsewhere this

4,scientists are playing an exotic game of pitch and catch between illinois and minnesota their catchers mitt is solid iron weighs    tons and is parked in northern minnesota in an abandoned iron mine with millions of dollars from the federal stimulus package construction crews are now building a second mitt near the canadian border its even heavier some    tons and is made of    liquid filled cells of pvc plastic five hundred miles to the south is the pitcher fermilab a sprawling us government laboratory west of chicago where physicists do violent things with tiny particles the objects in flight are very strange particles called neutrinos fermilab scientists have figured out how to generate a beam of neutrinos and send it across wisconsin to the big detectors in northern minnesota make that begin ital under end italwisconsin because the earth is round anyone wishing to send an object in a straight line from one spot on the planet to another spot   miles away must aim through the planet itself heres where the really weird physics kick in neutrinos blast right through the earth with nary a spark they interact so rarely and so weakly with normal matter that they can zip right through solid rock as though it were not even there    much like light through a clear glass window thats why contrary to the hopes of some private contractors who heard about a big new experiment under construction fermilab does not need to dig a tunnel underneath wisconsin a common adjective applied to neutrinos is ghostly they have no charge until recently it was unclear if neutrinos had any mass at all they do but just a smidgen trillions of neutrinos from the sun pass through our bodies every minute scientists say you could be hit with a neutrino beam right between the eyes without getting so much as a blemish these neutrinos are a type of matter that essentially form a shadow universe said marvin marshak a university of minnesota physicist working on the new neutrino experiment called nova they share space with us but they have very little interaction with us so you have neutrinos going through your body all the time    neutrinos from the sun neutrinos from the cosmic rays coming down from space neutrinos left over from the birth of the universe    but they go right through you nova had been shelved due to a funding shortfall but its back in business thanks to the american recovery and reinvestment act of      also known as the federal stimulus package forty million dollars are going to the nova detector in minnesota and another   million are heading to fermilab for a variety of projects including one to boost the power of the neutrino beam fermilab is famous for its tevatron an atom smasher housed in a tunnel beneath the illinois prairie the tevatron is going full blast as it searches for the higgs boson a particle theorized to exist in the higgs search fermilab is in something of a race against the new accelerator near geneva the large hadron collider which is currently under repair after a problem plagued start up last year fermilab is also busy generating neutrinos the physicists accelerate protons to nearly the speed of light and smash them into a target the collision creates a spray of new particles that in turn decay into neutrinos a magnetic lens called a horn then focuses the particles into a beam this neutrino beam is already being used for an experiment called minos for main injector neutrino oscillation search that uses the existing neutrino detector in the iron mine in soudan minn its an octagonal cylinder made up of   layers of iron it looks like a giant stop sign of the countless neutrinos fired its way minos catches only one or two a day thats in part because by the time the neutrino beam reaches northern minnesota it has become more diffuse the beam soon leaves the planet entirely and travels into outer space the new detector under construction is part of nova which will search for evidence of what is known as neutrino oscillation there are three families of neutrinos muon electron and tau one type can oscillate into another nova will look for evidence of muon neutrinos turning into electron neutrinos esoteric stuff not to particle physicists their goal in studying neutrinos is to solve a basic riddle of the universe    why is there more matter than antimatter the theorists do not yet have an explanation for why our universe in its initial moments did not have matter and antimatter in equal amounts the slight bias in favor of one kind of matter is essential to our existence because matter and antimatter annihilate one another had the quantities been precisely identical galaxies stars planets and people wouldnt be here at all scientists suspect that neutrinos and their ability to oscillate from one state to another may provide a clue to the mystery

3,new rebel chemical weapons attack in syriabrandon turbeville as rt reports the chemical weapons came in the form of an artillery shell which was detonated near the syriaturkey border in the city of ras al ayn al hasakah kurdish defense forces were the apparent targets of the chemical weapons detonation according to kurdish fighters on the ground after the shell was detonated a yellow smoke began emanating and many of them began experiencing symptoms of severe chemical intoxication source fighting has raged in ras al ayn al hasakah for at least two days and kurdish forces have been successful at repelling attacks by death squads seeking to overrun the area during the fighting the kurdish defense forces have managed to kill   death squad members belonging to both al qaeda linked jobhat al nusra front and the islamic state of iraq and the levant the kurdish population has come to resent the death squads as much other syrians even though the kurds initially attempted to remain as neutral as possible since the beginning of the conflict recently however kurds have been mobilizing armed militias in an attempt to defend their territory and neighborhoods from rebel assaults if reports coming from al mayadeen are accurate this would be at least the third instance in which chemical weapons have been used by death squads in syria with the previous two having initially been blamed on president bashar al assad and the syrian government by western nations and media propagandists as far back as june   the pieces were clearly seen being moved into place in order to create the environment and subsequent chain of events for a successful false flag attack used to justify an invasion of or at the very least some limited military action against syria however the more hidden aspects being used to create infrastructure for such an event could be seen going back even further i would encourage the readers to access my article propaganda overdrive suggests syria war coming soon in order to get a glimpse into the false narrative supplied by the western media regarding a series of propagandized chemical weapons attacks inside syria as a justification for military action aside from the question of false flag attacks however there remains an abundance of evidence that demonstrates the possession of chemical weapons by the death squads as well as their desire and means to use them keep in mind the report provided by dale gavlak of mint press which revealed admission by syrian death squads that they themselves were responsible for thechemical weapons attack in ghouta and the fact that the death squads claimed they were given both the chemical weapons and their salaries by saudi prince bandar bin sultan also known as bandar bush due to his close ties with the bush family the weapons were apparently supposed to have gone directly to al qaeda fighters such as jabhat al nusra in december   a video was obtained by the syria tribune and subsequently released in their report and posted on youtube which allegedly shows the nato backed death squads testing chemical weapons on lab rabbits as the syria tribune describes the video the syria tribune also comments that judging from the rabbits reaction the gas must be a nerve agent the number of containers if not a bluff indicates ability to produce a considerable amount of this gas deployment could be by means of a smoke generator placed in the target area an explosion possibly a suicide one of a chemmedcar or simply by using a humidifier in march   yet another youtube video was released which contained a clip of a second test of chemical weapons on captive rabbits by the death squads likewise on august     jerome corsi of world net daily released an article detailing photos audio recordings and clear video evidence of death squads possessing and using chemical weapons many of these videos can be seen linked or embedded in my own article total fabrication laid bare in march to war with syria thus if the reports coming out of lebanon are indeed accurate then the latest war crime committed by the foreign backed death squads should serve as yet another nail in the coffin of both the cause of the rebels and western credibility additional source read other articles by brandon turbeville here brandon turbeville is an author out of florence south carolina he has a bachelors degree from francis marion university and is the author of six books codex alimentarius the end of health freedom   real conspiraciesfive sense solutionsand dispatches from a dissident volume   and volume   and the road to damascus the anglo american assault on syriaturbeville has published over   articles dealing on a wide variety of subjects including health economics government corruption and civil liberties brandon turbevilles podcast truth on the tracks can be found every monday night   pm est at ucytv he is available for radio and tv interviews please contact activistpost at gmailcom
4,this was bound to happen as baseball pursues its love affair with arctic circle baseball in the capricious weather of autumn fielders have been known to lose track of the ball because of the sun the lights or the wind but erick aybar of the angels managed to lose track of a high pop up on friday night craning his neck to track the ball while wearing a bright red balaclava under his bright red cap players do not ordinarily wear this garb for home games in orange county calif to my benumbed way of thinking the balaclava must have had something to do with the gaffe the teams concluded their teeth chattering opener friday night with the yanks beating the angels     in the american league championship series they faced the possibility of heavy rain saturday night before heading to california where baseball actually makes sense at this time of year the players neither sissies nor complainers understand that their stupendous salaries come from playing postseason games at times dictated by the television networks and the fans being fans show up wearing winter clothes anybody can play this game with   degrees and its beautiful said mike scioscia a philly guy who manages the angels and has been working in california most of his adult life when its going to be like it is tonight scioscia said friday you have to keep your focus keep your focus defensively and certainly on the mound with whatever happens with the pitcher and the catcher bring your game plan out there and execute it as well as you can the angels did not execute particularly on a towering pop up after the yanks scored a run in the first inning aybar and third baseman chone figgins paid too much attention to each other and the ball dropped for a run scoring single aybar said he did not hear figgins who appeared to be shouting for him to take the pop up a resident of the dominican republic aybar said he had never played in such cold weather strange things do happen this time of year billy loes a pitcher with the brooklyn dodgers had a hard shot hit him in a knee as the go ahead run scored in the sixth game of the   world series against the yankees of course later loes said he had lost the ball in the sunlight which people made fun of for decades in reality the late afternoon sun did slant through the open stands of ebbets field in early october and could easily have disrupted loes thats right kids they used to play world series games in the sunlight which is why those times are called the good old days its a different age now with   teams instead of   and three tiers of postseason series forget about domes and roofs given modern drainage and field maintenance teams can play in serious rain and often do what with the huge advance ticket sales but that does not mean baseball has to give up on common sense if saturdays scheduled game   had to be called off because of rain baseball was set to play at   pm sunday with fox even willing to go against king football which it hates to do but major league baseball was stubbornly insisting that the monday game would remain at the scheduled   pm in anaheim meaning players would get no more than a few hours of sleep after the long flight from new york that plan smacks of rigid and in fact contemptuous thinking toward the players who have to live with any injuries or errors from lack of sleep all that was ahead of them friday as the yanks and angels played in windy   degrees scioscia said he had no rules about the protection the players could wear if you want to go out in short sleeves and show your tattoo off and do whatever god bless you he said if you want to go out there with   layers of clothes and you can still do what you can do to make a play hey were fine with that asked about the coldest he ever felt at a game scioscia recalled catching for the dodgers in the final game of the league series in   in montreal with the roof locked in an open position the expos had two runners on and two outs in the seventh fernando valenzuela really pitched a gem he recalled it was a pop up i looked up and i was getting under it and catching it through the snowflakes it was cold according to weather reports for oct     the temperature at mirabel airport ranged from   to   with winds gusting from   to   miles per hour and traces of moisture downtown and scioscia did better with warren cromarties pop up than aybar did with hideki matsuis on friday night scioscia said weather can also be erratic during the regular season    if youve ever been to wrigley field and that wind is blowing straight in it was not hard to miss the contrast in the other league series the phillies were playing in los angeles    a day game blue sky   degrees    as a cold night fell on the bronx we were like wow that weather looks pretty good compared to here said joe saunders scheduled to pitch the second game for the angels theyre there and were here we have to take care of business here well get back there soon enough by then aybar may have mastered the art of catching a pop up    with a stiff bronx wind lashing at his balaclava

2,at first i thought he was crazy for cutting holes in this cooler but then he attached with the advent of summer approaching shortly some of us will look for any way to beat the heat the temperatures in many parts of the country can reach sweltering levels and its sometimes not even worth going outside but spending too much time inside will inevitably lead to you running the air conditioner all day which can lead to quite an expensive electricity bill however if you were looking for a cheaper and more innovative way to cool down this summer i would definitely recommend putting together this diy homemade air conditioner all it takes it is an old cooler a pvc elbow tube and a small fan first draw a circle around the elbow on the top of the cooler and then another around the fan once youve cut the hole out stick the fan and elbow inside after you have it all hooked up fill the tub up with ice and youll have an air conditioner pumping out air at a cool   degrees fahrenheit it will surely keep you cool this summer share this to keep your friends and family feeling cool this summer

4,the supreme court agreed tuesday over the objections of the obama administration to hear a new appeal from guantanamo bay prisoners and decide whether a judge has the power to order the release of a detainee who is not a dangerous enemy combatant a ruling on this issue could complicate the administrations already troubled plans for closing the guantanamo prison until now the government and some lower courts have maintained that a judge cannot force the release of a guantanamo prisoner even one who has won his legal appeal in a court hearing at issue now is whether it is a judge or the president who has the power to decide the fate of a foreigner who was held as a military prisoner in addition the court agreed tuesday to decide whether if a judge does have that power he or she could order such a person released in the us or whether as the obama administration maintains that it is an immigration issue under the purview of the government last year the high court said in a     ruling that the guantanamo prisoners had a constitutional right to seek their freedom before a judge by filing a writ of habeas corpus they can ask a judge to decide whether the government has grounds for holding them as enemy combatants but the justices stopped short of saying the judge also had the authority to order the release of an inmate who was not an enemy combatant the bush administration and now the obama administration balked at releasing into the us several uighurs muslims mainly from a region in northeastern china who had been held at guantanamo since taking office early this year the obama administration has sought to find countries that will take these prisoners but it has also maintained the view that the executive branch not the judiciary has the ultimate power in deciding how and when to release them the supreme court has now agreed to hear a challenge to this view brought on behalf of several uighurs who were taken prisoner in afghanistan several trial judges have ruled that they are being wrongly held but a us appeals court has blocked their release us solicitor general elena kagan had urged the court to steer clear of the uighurs case while the administration seeks foreign countries that will take them in a recent letter she said only one of the uighurs has not been resettled but the justices may well be interested in resolving the broader question of a judges power to order the release of a wrongly held prisoner the court will hear the case of kiyemba v us early next year
3,major bank official banks are preparing for an economic nuclear winterby matt agorist in june of   former congressman ron paul predicted that these crutches would fail and the financial bubbles created by them would send the stock market into a free fall the consequences will not be minor surprises will be many since we are in uncertain waters and the world has never faced the gross misallocation of capital that exists today the process is self limiting it will come to an end and its not going to be far into the future now as chaos in the eu and weak corporate earnings create a tornado of uncertainty banks are preparing for the worst according to cnbc quoting a major lender banks are preparing for an economic nuclear winter situation the chaos in the market has major bank officials running for the hills according to cnbceuropean banks in particular have had a very tough six months as the shock and volatility around brexit sent banking stocks south major european banks like deutsche bank and credit suisse saw their shares in free fall after the referendums results were announced in the uk rbs was the worst hit with its shares plunging by more than   percent since june   on sunday a source speaking on the condition of anonymity due to the fact that revealing this information can get bankers killed a source from a major investment bank told cnbc that financial services firms have put together a strategy in place that takes into account the worst case scenario that could happen by the end of this year this could mean triggering article   referendum in other european nations leading to a break up of the euro or sterling hitting below    or lower the banks are ready for anything now the source said this grim warning comes afterthe royal bank of scotland has warned its investors of a cataclysmic yearin an eerily ominous note to its clientsearly this year the megabank predicted another worse case scenario sell everything except high quality bonds this is about return of capital not return on capital in a crowded hall exit doors are small in the note rbss credit chief andrew roberts told investors how quantitative easing has failed and was expected to fail we have been told for   years now since the credit crunch under qe to borrow money and invest it in one of   things   em   credit   global equities this is a big picture multi year bet that has been taken which has worked fine and stopped working   months ago this is not new as the guardians larry elliott points out markets have been supported for some time by low interest rates stimulus measures from central banks including quantitative easing and hopes of economic recovery but with the federal reserve raising rates and the bank of england expected to follow suit that prop is being removed those who pay attention to the effects of central bankers looting their respective countries have long pointed out the mathematical certainty that is an economic collapse the collapse of global markets is inevitable as it is a natural correction to the wholesale fleecing of the citizens through the unscrupulous actions of central banks ron paul sums up the situation perfectly the credit and new money when created by a central bank is delivered to the market in a political fashion for which the one percent receive special benefits it allows the pyramiding of debt to fractional reserve banking which compounds the long term problems it may be fun while it lasts but it always ends with a crash matt agorist is the co founder of thefreethoughtprojectcom where this article first appeared he is an honorably discharged veteran of the usmc and former intelligence operator directly tasked by the nsa this prior experience gives him unique insight into the world of government corruption and the american police state agorist has been an independent journalist for over a decade and has been featured on mainstream networks around the world follow mattagorist last year after a global economic meeting of national government reps we learned that the new economic system essentially represented by agenda   being rolled out is going to see an infusion of   trillion dollars of capital a tiny example being the saudis investing billions in uber this shift also involves a massive privatization scheme taking place all over the world recent examples include the saudis selling off state owned assets and russians doing the same oil and diamond mines qe can continue without creating massive inflation if deflationary measures are also taken eg the engineered sharp drop in oil prices however we have the fed calling for more inflation and bankster larry summer plotting ways to stoke inflation these harbingers do not equate to large scale collapse or stock market crash instead these signs hint at transformation think shell game and slow motion inflationary depression bringing on the elites desired   austerity and greater dependence on government handouts nice try but heads are going roll big time as this central bankster circus comes to an end i hope youre right many predicted the banksters comeuppance on the way to the   banking crisisunfortunately the only change was the banksters centralized their system even more btw i mentioned summers because hes always been at the forefront of big policy shifts including the repeal of glass steagall end of cash rise of bitcoin and digitalcrypto currencies global emergence of negative interest rates privatization of public assets etc youre exactly right but this time around lots of people got it figured out and most important lots have burned through their reserves and are beginning to hurt i understand friend and completely agree in fact im sure thats why tptb crashed the price of oil as a pressure venting mechanism aimed at the struggling working and middle classes how else to keep the plebs from outright revolt as housing and health care costs soar to the stratosphere tptb have already set their pins up for the next sweep preparing for a bigger shift towards austerity  squeezing inflationary recession largely boiling frogs style theres a bribery aspect too the floating of debt jubilees basic income increases in entitlement payouts targeted tax cuts and tax increases on the wealthy hillarys free college tuition etc the emergence of the   paradigm of austerity and restructuring in saudi arabia has been mostly seamless because there was a lot of wealth to begin with i wonder if that is similar to what well experience in the west simple solution sovereign nations to create issue and control through their treasuries debt free and interest free money that is based on the nations credit and potential very simple been done before job done central banks and banking dynasties to be arrested and put before juries time to clean out the augean stables the rule of law will prevail bingo i love it i think bringing back glass steagall would also help in the present fractional reserve lending system drastically increasing the lending reserve would stop this ponzi scheme of lending money on airpart of which is contributing the economic turmoil of our time your thoughts on this agree in addition shut down all central banks and deport all dual citizens its not revenge that motivates its getting that   trillion dollar balance sheet ransom against future growth prospects away from the fed and under control again you know somewhere along the line this culture has got to stop with the we must move on rhetoric seriously look at what moving on has gotten us has moving on crushed the privately ownedfractionalized banking of the fed res and its private collection agency the irs has it stopped our legislativeexecutive judicial branches from ripping our constitution and this nation to shreds if the thought of as you call it revenge is too harsh for you why not simply call it justice this sewer nations evil government has cost literally millions of lives our infrastructure like  th over all in developed nations etc i am tired of moving on i want to see heads roll real live prison sentences in real live prisons general population and public executions of the guilty not we the people at the hands of israeli trained le raid the eccles building lynch the governors turn the balance sheet over to social security the fed balance sheet pays everyone   grand a month as a base salary and persons could still work just not to survive global chaos again theft of sovereignty again huge loss of life again all merrily brought to us by the synagogue their judas class in dc and their central banks again ill tell you what if it was myself in that oval office and in charge id personally invite all the major banking leaders in this country into my office for a luncheon where id tell each and every one of them that if the banking system does implode ill personally deploy and direct the us homeland security people to find and arrest each and everyone of these criminals whod have a price on their heads declare them financial terrorists and throw them into the deepest darkest dungeon i could find until theyd come around tomy way of thinking if that didnt work quick enough id then show them my new printing press where we now issue us govt notes instead of federal reserve notes similar to what kennedy was doing when he was gunned down in dallas in   some say for doing this very thing before you took your first bite youd take a direct hit right between the eyes dude these people are playing for keeps this isnt a debating society well thanks matt for your speculation based on no investigative journalism but relying on cnbc and the guardian great sources for reliable information keep up the good work and get back to us when you have the ability to provide us some reliable and revealing information you are owned by the fed and if something were to happen  fed giving john q a chance to buy zero coupon bonds backed by its balance sheet you will be required to finance its war against real money run for your livesthe sky is fallingthe sky is falling lmao

3,things that can and will go wrong in a disastergaye levy contributor that brings me to the topic of todays article   things that can go wrong in a disaster i recently came across a listing of things that can go wrong during and following a disaster and while the list is not my original work i felt that it was a list worth sharing some of the points are common knowledge but others were surprising and to be honest a bit disconcerting as well most of the   items are negative and many go against what we commonly believe will occur as first responders and rescuers come on the scene so what is a prepper to do read through the list remind yourself that trained personnel are human too and that even with the best of training mistakes will be made things that will go wrong in a disaster   in an earthquake there may be violent ground shaking it will seem to last much longer than it actually does   fires will occur caused by electrical shorts natural gas fireplaces stoves etc   fires in collapsed buildings will be very difficult to control   emergency equipment and field units will commit without being dispatched there will be an air of urgency and more requests for aid than units available to send   communications will be inadequate holes will appear in the system and air traffic will be incredibly heavy   trained personnel will become supervisors because they will be too valuable to perform hands on tasks   responding mutual aid units will become lost they will require maps and guides   water will be contaminated and unsafe for drinking tankers will be needed for fire fighting and for carrying drinking water   citizens will volunteer but their commitment will usually be short term   there may be a multitude of hazardous materials incidents   aircraft will flood the area law enforcement fire media civilian commercial and military aircraft will be a major concern   the command post andor eoc will be overrun with non essential personnel media geologists architects engineers representatives from other jurisdictions etc   staging will be essential the flow of personnel equipment and supplies will be overwhelming   although it is an eoc function the field command post will become the temporary seat of government   electric power will be interrupted or will fail completely   it will be difficult to shut off the gas valves that are seldom if ever used will be difficult to find and may not work when they are found   phone service will be erratic or non existent pay phones will be the most reliable   the media will have the best communications available be prepared to share or impound their resources   fuel will not be available because there will be no electricity to run the pumps   there will be an epidemic of flat tires police fire and emergency medical vehicles will sustain a multitude of flat tires that will require repair in the field   fires will need to be investigated mutual aid should include arson investigators   the primary police department concern will be law enforcement there will not be sufficient time or manpower to provide miscellaneous services   it will be dark there will not be enough generators or lights available   portable toilets will be in demand there will be no place to go and if a place is found there will be six photographers there to cover the event   the perimeter will be difficult to control citizens and media alike will offer good reasons why they should be allowed to enter the restricted area   search dogs will be needed early in the operation   documentation will be very important there will be a multitude of requests for information later   riveted steel oil and water storage tanks may fail   streets will be impassable in some areas it will be necessary to clear streets of rubble in order to conduct emergency operations   the same buildings will be searched more than once unless they are clearly marked   in earthquakes there will be after shocks they will hamper emergency operations create new fears among the citizenry and may cause more destruction than the original shock   many injured people will have to find their own way to medical treatment facilities   volunteer and reserve personnel may be slow to respond they will put their own families safety first   on duty public safety personnel will be concerned about their own families and some may leave their posts to check on them   law enforcement and the media will clash all media representatives should be referred to the public information officer   very few citizens will utilize evacuationmass care centers they will prefer to stay with friends and relatives or to camp out in their own yards   structural engineers will be needed to evaluate standing buildings for use as evacuation centers command posts information centers first aid stations   the identification of workers and volunteers will be a problem it will be difficult to determine who is working where and on what   there will be rumors people will be listening to their radios and must be given accurate information   there will not be enough handie talkies batteries will soon go dead   many fire hydrants will be inaccessible covered or destroyed by rubble or inoperable   generators will run out of fuel jerry cans of fuel must be obtained early to maintain generator powered lighting and communications   critical facilities will have to be self sufficient gas lights water and sewage may be out for days   emergency responders will require rest and must be relieved local personnel may be of value as guides for mutual aid responders or as supervisors for volunteer crews   equipment will be lost damaged or stolen and may never be accounted for   someone will get the bill record keeping and accounting procedures will be important   traditional non emergency personnel will want to go home at   oclock all public employees must be made to realize that they are a part of the emergency response team   people will die and there is nothing that can be done about it non public safety personnel will not understand why everyone cannot be saved priorities must be set to save the most lives possible   dead bodies should not be an initial concern rescuing the living should be the first priority   if phones are working the number of requests for service will be overwhelming people will have to fend for themselves it will be difficult for dispatchers to ignore these pleas for help   some field units will disappear you will not be able to reach them and will not know where they are or what they are doing   security will have to be posted at hospitals clinics and first aid stations to control hysterical citizens demanding immediate attention   representatives from public agencies throughout the united states and many foreign countries will want to come and observe the operations or offer assistance they will be a significant problem   department heads eoc staff may not have a working knowledge of their assigned areas of responsibility and will play it by ear   some citizens and media representatives will question your decisions because they will not recognize that the safety of field responders is paramount   there are no critically injured in a disaster only those who are dead or alive   handicapped and disabled persons will probably die unless personal family and friends can care for them and maintain their life support systems   management will not be familiar with field response procedures and may attempt to change standard operating procedures   emergency responders public safety and medical alike will not be adequately trained to respond efficiently   there will be initial chaos supplies materials and equipment needed will not be readily available   there will be a general lack of necessary information coordinators will want to wait for damagecasualty assessment information to establish priorities   emergency equipment will not be able to reach some locations because of traffic jams tow trucks will be at a premium parked or abandoned vehicles will block streets and emergency responders will be the worst offenders   even though there will not be enough people to initially deal with emergencies many available personnel will never be identified and never used after the initial shock there will be too many volunteers   general information will be offered in response to specific questions because field units cannot verify the requested information   individual public safety officers will be asked to do the work of squads or companies they will have to recruit volunteers on the spot to provide assistance to their efforts   the message flow to from and within the eoc and field command post will break down and become inefficient and unmanageable   there will be an over critical desire to verify all incoming information if it is received from a field unit it should be considered as verified   some eoc and command post personnel will become overloaded some will not be able to cope with the volume of activity and information they have to deal with and some will not be able to cope with the noise and distractions   things will get better some time after they have become considerably worse credit for this list a july     article by lt dan blackston chula vista police department as you read through this list of   things that can go wrong following a disaster realize that while many of these things may not happen each and every time there is an emergency many of them will indeed occur and it is true things will get better eventually but they may

1,media outlets in the uk have been warned that they will face sanctions if they give airtime to false coronavirus health advice  the warning came after a sussex radio station was given a severe warning for broadcasting baseless conspiracy theories connecting the pandemic to the rollout of  g  ofcom the government approved media watchdog ordered the station to broadcast an apology in a manner of the regualtors choosing and warned other media outlets that it would be stepping up its monitoring  the guardian reports members of the public complained after hearing a broadcast on the community radio station uckfield fm in which a woman introduced as a registered nurse claimed without any evidence that the rollout of  g phone technology in wuhan was connected to the outbreak and that the virus had been created in a lab  it later emerged that she was a practitioner of alternative medicines while the media regulator said it was not aware of any reputable scientific evidence to corroborate such a contentious claim which runs contrary to all official advice both in the uk and internationally about coronavirus  ofcom confirmed it was actively monitoring television and radio stations that might be broadcasting potentially harmful views about the causes and origins of covid   that have the potential to undermine peoples trust in the advice of mainstream sources of information during the crisis  baseless suggestions that coronavirus is linked to  g have spread widely in recent weeks on whatsapp facebook groups and on the fast growing community website nextdoor  all of which have the ability to reach vastly more people than a small community radio station in sussex but are much less regulated  the spread of baseless material on whatsapp connecting  g to coronavirus has now been covered in many mainstream news outlets boosted by social media posts by celebrities such as the actor woody harrelson  this poses a conundrum for those seeking to convince the public that the fears are unfounded fact checking organisations often find that people are reluctant to change their mind once convinced of an issue if they are simply told they are wrong despite international agencies finding there are no health risks associated with  g and no link to coronavirus there is also the risk that declining trust in mainstream media means that attempts to stop the claims spreading are seen as a cover up  in the case of uckfield fm ofcom reported that the guest also used her appearance to launch a lengthy attack on health professionals in the nhs dealing with the pandemic  she said just because you have this qualification do not wear that like a crown of glory  the days are gone when you were a doctor and a nurse and everybody trusted you those days are well gone do your own research do not trust a qualification i know many people who are very qualified who know very little because remember the people that own the establishments that teach us it all travels back to the same thing its all owned by big pharma they own the medical elite and they determine what gets published

1,predicting the future is always notoriously difficult the unprecedented response to the covid   crisis means most bets are off on what may happen apart from reinforcing the idea there is no alternative to state intervention  albert einstein famously quipped that he never thought about the future because it came soon enough he might have been a genius but he didnt experience the coronavirus crisis  and thus could not imagine a time when society would be so obsessed with thinking about the future  there are a number of difficulties with trying to anticipate what society might be like after this crisis in the first instance we have no idea how long this will go on experts disagree some suggest lockdowns could be relaxed in three months the uk government is now planning on at least six months in each case the outcomes could be significantly different  second whatever happens in the future we can be sure there will be continuities and disruptions and destructive and constructive dynamics at play crises are never one way streets  but  and this is critical  the coronavirus crisis will not bring year zero a new era or clean slate in which what happened in the past will disappear or can be ignored nor will pandemics be the new normal the exceptional peacetime actions taken by governments and central banks and the reorganisation of society and the economy around lockdowns  which is inducing some behavioural changes  are temporary not permanent  read more  but the consequences particularly of the unprecedented global state bailout which the financial times estimates to be around   tn will have a direct bearing on the future and in different ways  the increased role of the state in the economy and society is the one definite in a sea of uncertainty in the uk the government has promised loans and grants to businesses worth  bn and basic pay for company employees who are left workless the treasury is propping up wage support grants tax holidays and loan guarantees it has relaxed banking regulations to ensure lenders can provide   billion of extra credit and the authorities are using moral suasion to conscript them into the covid war effort and back small businesses even despite this it is estimated that at least a fifth of small businesses will collapse  with echoes of a wartime command economy ministers are coordinating supermarkets to distribute food and manufacturers to make ventilators this might evoke wartime parallels but the analogy is inapt  why because in real global wars capital is destroyed and forced to restructure which creates the conditions for renewed growth the post war boom demonstrated this all too clearly in the  th century  in the coronavirus war however state spending and mobilisation are geared towards propping up pre existing stagnation and this is what is being studiously ignored in the many fantasies being suggested as heralding the future  also on rtcom the us was named the best equipped country to deal with a pandemic not a year ago  what happened there  claims that this crisis is forcing traditional business to embrace the digital age for example are merely highlighting how vacuous the claims made by many are that we have been in a new fast moving age of disruption and innovation the fact that some old line industries  from media and entertainment through retail to food and beverages  are having to go online to survive the lockdown highlights how stagnant not innovative so much of our economy has been and remains  the idea too that people working from home represents the future world of work is another make believe forecast while this may appeal to doomsday environmentalists  less commuting means less congestion less pollution and lower co   the real issue is what work they might be doing rather than the fact that it is at home is it productive or decorative  the so called coronavirus war has revealed another less acknowledged reality of the stagnant economy namely that many essential jobs in our society are unskilled or semi skilled and that we depend more on these than the much hyped white collar information or service workers how much difference would it make if many of the latter jobs simply disappeared but the absence of construction agricultural transport delivery and indeed health workers to name a few brings home the fact that even in the digital age we depend upon material production in sectors that have suffered decades of stagnation non investment and non innovation  even some highlights of the current crisis like project pitlane  the collaboration of seven f  engineering teams based in england to rapidly develop a continuous positive airway pressure breathing device  should not be over hyped without diminishing the accomplishment we should soberly reflect on the fact that the best of british engineering has re engineered an existing off patent device not created a breakthrough in health care  read more  project pitlane speaks to something quite critical about the future the immediate crisis has made the world unfamiliar but yesterdays ideas have not disappeared wokeness identity politics inter generational conflicts and the culture of low expectations will be back with a vengeance  more importantly the risk averse culture of precaution around climate change in particular will be larger than life why because what people have seen in the behaviour of the state  particularly the disbanding of the rule book of fiscal responsibility  will raise the obvious question if all this is what was necessary to deal with covid   what about the climate emergency after all covid   accomplished what greta and extinction rebellion were advocating shut down schools stop flights stop people driving cars reduce our carbon footprints stop fossil fuel exploitation etc  and this is surely the point about the future while the economic consequences are going to be felt for generations to come the more immediate effect will be its political impact  what covid   has already accomplished is the final nail in the coffin of the phoney post war ideological battle between free marketeers and state socialists already the banners flying in society have inscribed there is no alternative to the state following margaret thatchers famous dictum there is no alternative to the market after the collapse of the soviet union in    when howard davies the chairman of royal bank of scotland jokingly quipped in the financial times that if the government said it was nationalising all the uks shoe shops people would regard it as entirely plausible he was not exaggerating  there has been no argument there has been no political debate but the state has won and everything else will follow if we thought yesterdays tendency towards technocracy was strong we havent seen anything yet the authoritarian trends already on display in the current lockdown are perhaps a harbinger of a future society run along managerial principles  but crises are never one way streets the examples of social solidarity we have seen suggest there are other forces at play that may positively influence the future this remains an unknown but the renewal of the role of the state is not we do not need to speculate about its future it has already arrived  think your friends would be interested share this story
1,its nice to see people coming out and supporting trump instead of condemning him if hillary clinton wanted to recruit some of the independent voters she just lost that chance jill stein just came out and destroyed hillary clinton and everything she stands for in the video she says that donald trump is better and that hillary clinton more likely is start nuclear war she also goes on to say that donald trump wants to seek a peaceful route with russia rather than basically declaring an air war on them by trying to create a no fly zone over syria russia has already been very outspoken that they will shoot down any us planes flying in their controlled syrian territory stein also goes on to talk about how gorbachev has said that we are closer to nuclear war with russia than we ever have been because of hillary clintons policies hillary policies will start a war with russia that will go nuclear stein brings up a good point that she wont sleep well at night if hillary clinton were to get elected i cant imagine anyone would with the threat of nuclear war looming over our countrys head this is huuuge for donald trump even the independents are beginning to hop on the trump train hillary clinton was definitely hoping she would win some of the independent vote but not after this everyone is finally starting to see hillary clinton for the crook that she really is this country cant afford a nuclear war let alone the world we cant let hillary put our entire country at risk like this donald trump is the best option and he will find a peaceful solution with russia rather than starting wwiii obama was the one that laughed that the cold war was over but he has only continued it in the darkness

2,voting machines in chicago literally switch republicans votes to democratic see for yourself donald trump has faced immense criticism for his claims that the election is rigged in hillary clintons favor liberals have done everything they can to portray him as a ego centric conspiracy theorist but the facts dont lie according to fox news early voting got off to a rocky start in illinois this week when votes being cast for republican candidates were transformed into votes for democrats when republican state representative candidate jim moynihan went to vote monday at the schaumburg public library he was met with a shocking surprise i tried to cast a vote for myself and instead it cast the vote for my opponent moynihan said you could imagine my surprise as the same thing happened with a number of races when i tried to vote for a republican and the machine registered a vote for a democrat local reports revealed that while using a touch screen voting machine in schaumburg moynihan voted for several races on the ballot only to find that whenever he voted for a republican candidate the machine registered the vote for a democrat in the same race he notified the election judge at his polling place and demonstrated that it continued to cast a vote for the opposing candidates party the illinois review continued moynihan was eventually allowed to vote for republican candidates including his own race sadly this is not the first incident of its kind what do you think is this absolutely unacceptable
