After a 30–20 win over the Arizona Cardinals on Sunday, Carolina Panthers quarterback Cam Newton was feeling confident enough to try out a bold new pair of kicks. Here they are. Cam Newton's out here wearing shoes that look like pepper jack cheese pic.twitter.com/Cf5ExgTf9j Yes, the news is true: I am the official supplier of Cam Newton's shoes pic.twitter.com/PqUpGVsKYo Yep. As observed above, they look like they're made out of cheese.  Twitter didn't take too kindly to the $1,100 Giuseppe Zanotti cheese sneaks, but in their collective disgust, online critics failed to make a crucial distinction. That's not pepper jack, that's dill havarti. Pepper jack is undeniably more popular in the world of deli cheese. Dill havarti is a sideline contender, but one might argue that after Sunday's big game, it was dill havarti that got called up to the starting position. Note that pepper jack has larger flakes of red and brown pepper— those little greenish-black fibers in the pale yellow cheese more closely resemble tiny sprigs of dill. But not everyone even saw cheese. One person thought the shoes looked like cookies and cream, and another misguided individual thought they looked like pizza sticks. When you get excited because you think it's pizza dipper day for lunch but it's just Cam Newton's shoes. pic.twitter.com/gTKAyMtiAp Though beauty is in the eye of the beholder and fashion is a personal expression, people came down pretty hard on Cam's shoe selection.  But in its collective uproar, it seems as if Twitter got the whole thing wrong. Dill havarti, people.  Though, upon closer inspection, maybe the shoes are actually made out of Funfetti?
