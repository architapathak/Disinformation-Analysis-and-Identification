(The following statement was released by the rating agency) Link to Fitch Ratings' Report: 2017 Outlook: North America Sovereigns here NEW YORK/LONDON, November 30 (Fitch) The election of Donald Trump as US president with a Republican-controlled Congress heralds a policy shift towards tax cuts and deregulation, which would be positive for growth in the short term, and a risk of protectionism, which would be negative over the medium term. Policy outcomes are uncertain at this early stage, with Congress potentially more hawkish on the fiscal deficit than the president-elect. Fitch expects a looser fiscal stance will lead to larger deficits and higher debt. We assume that tax cuts will deliver a fiscal loosening of around 0.7pp of GDP in 2017 and 2018, as a scaled-back version of Trump's campaign platform is adopted. This will lead to faster growth in debt/GDP than our previous baseline. Extended over the medium term, this could put pressure on sovereign creditworthiness, but there is no immediate risk to the US' AAA rating, which is supported by the sovereign's unparalleled financing flexibility and the dollar's status as the pre-eminent reserve currency. Tax cuts will provide a short-term boost to growth in the US, reaching 2.2% in 2017, tempered by some uncertainty over policy which could hold back a forecast revival in business investment. A strengthening dollar and rising interest rates will form mild headwinds to the growth outlook but monetary policy will remain accommodative, notwithstanding our expected path of Fed tightening. We expect a 25bp hike in December and two further hikes, totalling 50bp, in 2017. In Canada we also expect a recovery in investment - both private and public - to drive a recovery to 1.9% growth in 2017, even as consumption growth decelerates. Overvalued housing markets and high household debt pose risks to growth. Recent macro-prudential tightening measures to cool the housing market will also cool economic activity. Canada is highly dependent on trade with the US, but given Canada's modest trade surplus with the US, we see it as less exposed than Mexico to US attempts to rewrite or withdraw from the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta). On the basis of gross general government debt, Canada is the second most indebted 'AAA' sovereign and the rating has limited tolerance for further increases. We expect gross general government debt to remain at 93% of GDP in 2017, with the general government running modest deficits. A fiscal loosening at the federal level, driven by infrastructure and other spending commitments, will result in the deficit peaking in 2017 at 1.3% of GDP. Federal debt is much lower at 33% of GDP. Significant growth underperformance or fiscal deterioration could pose risks to the rating. The full report, is available at www.fitchratings.com or by clicking the link above.

In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed.
