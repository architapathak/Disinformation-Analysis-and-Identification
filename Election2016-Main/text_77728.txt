There's something quite comforting about Green Day having such a big say in this week's news cycle. In the year of our Lord two zero one six, with America seemingly teetering on the edge of oblivion, an inferiority complex-riddled sausage running for the highest office in the land, one month away from a hugely important general election, we have Revolution Radio and a conversation about pop-punk's legacy to go along with it. Try not to get to nostalgic for that righteous anti-Bush fury, the YouTube loops of George Carlin that might've pulled you through a decade back. If you want sharp, poetic anger, listen Kate Tempest's new record; if you want a defiant statement of self, try Lizzo's Coconut Oil. Both of those make it onto this week's 13 most significant releases. You can listen to them all below.  ​Lead photo via Green Day on Instagram. ​​Follow Noisey on Twitter​.​
