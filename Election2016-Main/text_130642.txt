Berkeley High School Walkout — B (@BerenabasG)November 9, 2016 As the reality of Donald Trump's unprecedented election upset continues to settle in, high school students across the country have been getting up from their desks and walking out of class to protest the new president-elect.  Students in Arizona kicked off the movement by staging a walkout on Tuesday before the election results came in, protesting Donald Trump and Sheriff Joe Arpaio, who ended up losing his reelection bid in the state. About a dozen Muslim students from North High School reportedly joined up with a group of roughly 200 students from Maryvale High School to rally near polling sites with a giant blowup figure of the notorious law man waring a prison jumpsuit, according to the Arizona Republic.

At least 1,500 students at Berkeley High School—one known for its protests—marched across campus, chanting "not my president" and "love trumps hate."
