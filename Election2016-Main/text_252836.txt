If there's one thing you can say about 2016, it's that it was extremely 2016. Prince died? That's 2016 for you. Trump got elected? So 2016. People got mad about a Star Wars movie starring a woman? It's 2016, alright. Racists were upset about a black Santa? Incredibly, uniquely 2016. Tweeting "this is the most 2016 thing" is a common trope that relatively meme-aware but ultimately not-that-clever internet users (that is to say, most of us) employed whenever something completely messed up happened this year. It denotes the ludicrousness of whatever just transpired, while highlighting the general mood of the time. Pegging all of the ugliness to a finite stretch of 365 days also offers the hope that it'll all be over soon. Unfortunately, the problems that seem like they could only ever exist in the mud and the shit of 2016 all go back decades and even centuries. They'll continue to stretch into 2017 and onwards forever and ever until we finally destroy the root causes, if we ever manage to do that. Maybe, then, saying that something terrible or just plain crazy is "the most 2016 thing" is actually a mental defense mechanism that allows us to frame the day's problems as temporary. Maybe it also allows us to shore up nostalgia for years that we remember more fondly. Or maybe it's just lazy tweeting. A fugitive sending police a better mugshot was the most 2016 thing.
