Around 1:30 AM on Wednesday morning, after all our party guests had shuffled off into the night, I got tired of waiting for the official call of Pennsylvania and went for a short walk. I was curious to see if anyone was out and about in my Brooklyn neighborhood, if people were still holding on to Hillary hope. It was a ghost town; even everyone's favorite local watering hole was sparse, probably less people than in the normal witching hours. I stopped at a deli for a bottle of water. Inside, the Middle Eastern clerk was talking to a Latino dude, still in his dusty work clothes. I asked what they thought, and they both kind of shrugged. After a few beats, the Latino guy said, "All we can do is what we do." All we can do is what we do. Rise and grind. I didn't need cable news for the results anyway. From here on out, I'm getting all my election results from Joel Embiid. And screw Canada, I'm pricing apartments in Cameroon. Speaking of the grind, there was NBA action! And the Grizzlies and the Nuggets put on quite a show at the end of the world game on Tuesday night. Down 106-105, the Nuggets ran a beauty of a sideline trap on Mike Conley leading to an Emmanuel Mudiay dunk to take a one-point lead with 7.9 left. Somehow, both teams managed to turn the ball over, leading to a Marc Gasol buzzer beating tip-in with .7 seconds on the clock. Meanwhile, in Cleveland, the Atlanta Hawks ended an eleven-game losing streak, including two playoff sweeps, to the Cavaliers 110-106. Dennis Schroder went for a career-best 28 points as the Hawks held off a furious Cavs comeback. He did what he could do.
