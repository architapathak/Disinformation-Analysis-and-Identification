There's only one way to celebrate Thanksgiving: Curl up on the couch with some turkey, a slice of pumpkin pie, and a copy of the November issue of VICE magazine. Inside, you'll find a photo essay featuring our resident drug expert Hamilton Morris, who tries Salvia divinorum during a traditional Mazatec shaman ceremony; a profile of Loving director Jeff Nichols; and a Q&A with New York's first openly undocumented lawyer, Cesar Vargas. Meanwhile, Jacob Kushner cruises on Carnival's new subsidiary, which offers tourists a chance to create "enduring social impact" in the Dominican Republic, and Clancy Martin shares what he's learned from his numerous stints in jail, in his personal essay "Seven Times Inside." We also get a sneak peak of an upcoming book from Fantagraphics that includes the complete works of Fletcher Hanks, a comic book auteur with a disturbing and mysterious past. In addition, we report on how the violence in Acapulco still rages on, ten years into the drug war; we break down global elections by the numbers; and we spend time exploring Mexico's colonial history with one of the country's preeminent female bullfighters. Of course, we've got photos, too. Our cover features Michele Sibiloni, who documented Uganda's nocturnal grasshopper trappers, and Mauricio Alejo presents his latest portfolio, which captures unreal images in everyday life. Our spotlight centers on the controversial Ilisu Dam in Turkey and the up-and-coming photographer Katya Rezvaya. For his recurring FOIA column, Jason Leopold explains how the FBI communicated with the family of an American drone-strike victim. There's much more... And don't forget: You can get the magazine (100-plus glossy pages) delivered to your doorstep each month by subscribing.
