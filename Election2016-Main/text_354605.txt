While athletes have been mostly silent this election cycle (it's almost over!) and steered clear of endorsements save for a few, they have been more assertive with their money. A number of high-profile current and former players and coaches have donated money to the Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump campaigns this year. CBS Sports compiled them all in one place but there are a few interesting ones to note, on both sides of the moneyed aisle, with 59 sports people donating in total. Hillary definitely has the bigger (and longer list of) names, but Trump also got 28 bucks from a race car driver, so...yeah.
