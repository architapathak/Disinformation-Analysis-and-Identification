Don’t ignore your School House Rock nostalgia a second longer. We’re reimagining the '80s classic “I’m Just a Bill” to explore 2010’s Citizens United Supreme Court decision — a landmark ruling that categorized political spending as free speech and galvanized the invention of massive, and often anonymous, political fundraising organizations known as Super PACs. If that sounds crooked to you, you’re not alone; elected officials and voters alike have cried foul at Super PACs’ growing influence, arguing that the wealthy shouldn’t have more sway because of their fatter wallets. Watch the video for a crash course in these shady fundraising initiatives — and the tactics their opponents are using to fight the conflation of money with speech.This video is part of We the Voters, a social impact campaign incorporating high-profile celebrities, real political players, and dynamic story lines into a series of groundbreaking short films and apps.
