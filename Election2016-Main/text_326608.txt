Venus X is not your average DJ and her exclusive holiday playlist, created for Vogue, is not your average collection of holiday tunes. "My holiday music playlist is a combination of music to cook to, wrap gifts to, and ultimately dance to," she told the magazine. Most of the tracks on her playlist are non-seasonal, with selections from Kamixlo, Lotic and Solange, among others. However, the seasonal music is not completely missing. Toward the end, she includes, "All I Want for Christmas is You," a classic for millennials and Gen X folks everywhere.
