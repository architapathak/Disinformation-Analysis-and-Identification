Add future Houston Mayor to WWE legend Booker T's accomplishments ... 'cause the HOF wrestler tells TMZ Sports he's running for mayor, and there's no doubt he's gonna win. We talked to Booker -- who announced this week he's running for mayor of Houston in 2019 -- about why he's diving into politics ... and whether he has a chance to actually win. The short answer ... hell yes. "I'm gonna win the election. That's almost a forgone conclusion. I have a lot of support. Especially from the city, the young people in the city." But, why not start with a smaller job before running for mayor of a city with over 2 million people? "I'm 6'3", I'm 250 lbs., I'm a big guy. I think the mayoral position is the position for Booker T."
