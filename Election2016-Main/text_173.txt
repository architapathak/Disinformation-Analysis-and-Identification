We're another week into October, which means we have another week's worth of information to use to start projecting what the 2016-17 college football bowl lineup will look like. The top four teams go to the Playoff, regardless of conference, and the remaining New Year's Six bowls are filled out with conference tie-ins and at-large bids. All bowls have conference tie-ins, but those are broken when conferences can't fill all of their slots. Here's a good look at the tie-in and selection process. Teams have to be at least 6-6 to make a bowl, but if there aren't enough 6-6 teams to fill all of the slots, 5-7 teams are selected based on their Academic Progress Rate. The projected Playoff—Alabama vs. Washington and Ohio State vs. Clemson—and national championship—Alabama vs. Ohio State— are the same as Week 6 and should still produce an incredible set of games. Other intriguing matchups: Texas A&M vs. Oklahoma, Florida State vs. Tennessee, Nebraska vs. Arkansas and, somehow, a Rose Bowl with Washington State.
