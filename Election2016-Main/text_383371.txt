As the election comes in much tighter than anticipated, many people feel in need of a good scream. At this point in the night, the entire country is too close to call and people on Twitter are not exactly taking things calmly. But Stephen Colbert's Late Show has a solution. Namely: A screaming booth. The booth was installed at 53rd and Broadway in New York's midtown and people have taken ample advantage of it.

The full stream of the booth is available below.
