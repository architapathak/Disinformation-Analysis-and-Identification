Chancellor Philip Hammond promised the UK will "strike back" against foreign cyber-attacks, as he announced new details about a £1.9 billion government investment in cybersecurity. Speaking at the Microsoft Future Decoded conference in London on Tuesday, the government minister declared that "the tech industry is the future of the British economy, and that "trust in the internet and the infrastructure on which it relies is fundamental to our future." He was there to give new details about the National Cyber Security Strategy, first announced in 2015 by George Osborne, the then-chancellor. This includes improving investment in the industry — and developing more offensive capabiliies to strike back at attackers. "A small number of hostile foreign actors" have developed "destructive" cyber-capabilities, Hammond said, which "threaten the security of the UK's critical national infrastructure. "If we do not have the ability to respond in cyber-space," he warned, "we would be left with the impossible choice of turning the other cheek ... or resorting to a military response." Hammond's remarks come after MI5 boss Andrew Parker told The Guardian in an interview that Russia is a growing threat to Britain's security— in part because of its cybersecurity capabilities. Russia has been accused by American intelligence officials of meddling in the US election — hacking Democratic Party members in an apparent attempt to undermine the legitimacy of the election. The Chancellor obliquely referenced Russia's capabilities while discussing the hack of French TV station TV5 Monde, an attack ostensibly by a terror group but which security experts belive may have been carried out by Russia. Hammond referred to "a state with a record of other high-profile attacks — answers on a post card to No. 11 Downing Street please." The National Cyber Security Strategy will be based around three pillars, Hammod said: Defend, Deter, and Develop.
