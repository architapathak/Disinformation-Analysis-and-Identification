Vic Mensa released one of 2016's more pointed political albums with There's a Lot Going On, finding a focus for his newly enraged music in police brutality and self-examination. Mensa wrote an op-ed for Billboard that elaborates on those themes in the wake of Donald Trump's U.S. election win. Mensa recounts feeling "woozy" upon learning of the results and proceeds to share his thoughts on a variety of subjects including why the poor shouldn't blame each other, how Trump supporters should be reached out to after "we've been preaching to the crowd this whole time," and that nothing would have changed for black Americans had Hillary Clinton won because "this nation was not built to serve our interests."
