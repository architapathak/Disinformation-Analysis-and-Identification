In the wake of Donald Trump's election as president, there has been plenty of talk about people leaving the country before the January 20th inauguration. For Americans who are already abroad, there's the option to just stay. American winger Ella Masar, who plays for top-division Swedish side FC Rosengård, joked to the Malmö-based newspaper Sydsvenskan that she wants to stay with the club as long as Trump is president. "I actually went in to see Therese [Sjögran, sporting director of FC Rosengård] and asked to sign on for another four years at the club so I do not have to go back to the US with Donald Trump as president," she said. Masar, a self-proclaimed Democrat, added that she's even had an unfavorable personal interaction with the president-elect. "I've actually met him once. We had to go there for an Easter dinner and I thought then that he was a scary man." Masar, 30, expected that her 2015 season with the Houston Dash would be her final year, but said after the season that she never felt in better shape. Since signing with FC Rosengård, Masar has produced a blistering 13 goals in 21 games. She also plays alongside her wife, Canadian Erin McLeod, the team's keeper. Masar added in her interview with Sydvenskan, "I'm also happy that I even have a Canadian passport." [h/t 101 Great Goals] Correction: This post, originally published with the headline "American Soccer Player Ella Masar Inks Four-Year Deal in Sweden to Avoid Trump Presidency," was based on an interview Masar gave with a Swedish newspaper in which she mentioned asking her club, FC Rosengård, to let her stay for four more years while Trump is president. Masar has since clarified in a statement that this was said "in jest" and that she has not signed any new deal with Rosengård. The headline and the post have been updated to reflect this. We regret the error. Thanks the record. Moving on ... — Ella Masar McLeod (@emasar3)November 11, 2016
