Ice Cube has a very bold take on the election ... saying we're screwed either way, and the only way to fix it is to get Obama back in the White House for 4 more years. Cube appears on Too $hort's BoomBox podcast with Bobby Loco Wednesday and the upcoming election is a major talking point. It's interesting -- Cube urges the public they've got to work hard no matter who gets elected prez -- but he says the best solution for everybody is to just get Obama back in office. Ice Cube's the inaugural guest on Short's podcast ... but the veteran rapper has a whole season of celeb guests lined up, and a new episode will drop every Wednesday.
