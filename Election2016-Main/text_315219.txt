With the election only a few months away and the race getting increasingly tighter, Bernie Sanders sat down with Seth Meyers Thursday night to once again plea with his supporters to bring people onboard with Clinton and keep Trump from the White House. On Thursday's episode of Late Night, Meyers addressed Trump's recent surge in the polls, asking Sanders, "What do you say to your supporters now? What do you want them to do moving forward?" "We've got to get beyond personality," the Vermont senator said. "What I would ask of those people who voted for me is, even if you have concerns about Clinton—I understand—but look at the hard issues that impact your lives and your neighbor's lives and then think whether or not you want Donald Trump to become president. I think if you frame it in that way, people will end up voting for Clinton. "I don't think there's any reason for anyone to believe that Trump is going to stand with working people," he continued. "He's a billionaire; his proposals call for massive tax breaks for the wealthiest people in this country. This is not a guy who, in my view, is going to stand up for working people." Bernie was just one of a whole slew of personalities from the 2016 election to hit the late-night circuit this week—Trump palled around with Jimmy Fallon on the Tonight Show Thursday and Bill Clinton headed in for an interview on the Daily Show—but Sanders's guest appearance was the most focused discussion about the upcoming election stakes, with real, nuanced conversation and not a single hair tussle.
