Kellyanne Conway says Donald Trump cranked tons of music on the campaign trail, and didn't let a little thing like an artist's public disapproval stop him from enjoying any of it. We got Trump's campaign manager Thursday morning in D.C., where she told us who the Prez-elect listened to most leading up to the election ... we gotta say, he's got good taste. As for all the musicians who've come out against Trump ... well, Kellyanne says the Prez-elect has a way to reconcile that too. She even drops a hint on who might perform at his inauguration.
