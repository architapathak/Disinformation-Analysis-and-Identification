Sometimes you don't have the time, energy, or tools to whip up some longwinded, frisée-topped dinner entrée. In fact, we would argue that that's the vast majority of the time. Whether it's because you're exasperated by neverending work emails, mentally fatigued from the merciless avalanche of harrowing election coverage, or just plain NOT IN THE MOOD, OK?, something you just need a semi-homemade meal. In comes this barbecue salmon. It's delicious, it's affordable, and it's so simple to prepare that its creator—Albert Johnson, a.k.a. Prodigy from Mobb Deep—has made it in prison. Like, the slammer. No frills, big flavor. He recently stopped by the MUNCHIES Kitchen to show us how the magic happens. (Check out his new book Commissary Kitchen: My Infamous Prison Cookbook.) And yeah, it starts with canned salmon. No shame in that. See how magical things get when you factor in rice, barbecue sauce, hot sauce, Parmesan, butter, and pre-made seasoning. From now on, "this tastes like jail food" just might be a compliment.
