Bill Gates took the trek to Trump Tower Tuesday to kiss the ring. Gates was the latest of the famous folk to visit the President-elect. He was preceded by Kanye West, Jim Brown and Ray Lewis ... all of whom had a chitchat with Donald Trump. A rep for the Microsoft billionaire tells us he was there to discuss innovation in energy, health and education, and American leadership in foreign aid. It's interesting ... for the most part famous people -- especially in Hollywood -- wouldn't dare visit, much less support Trump, but it's amazing how a little thing like an election and the thirst for access can change things in a flash.
