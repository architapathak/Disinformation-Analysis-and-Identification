The KKK wasn't the only extremist group to praise Donald Trump's victory last week. News outlets associated with ISIS, like the al Minbar Jihadi Media network, came out in support of the decision, calling it "the imminent demise of America," USA Todayreports, and top ISIS and Taliban commanders now say Trump's presidency will be a powerful recruitment tool. "This guy is a complete maniac. His utter hate towards Muslims will make our job much easier because we can recruit thousands," Abu Omar Khorasani, a top ISIS commander in Afghanistan, told Reuters.  Reuters also spoke with an unnamed Taliban militant leader, who said, "If he does what he warned in his election campaign, I am sure it will provoke Muslim Ummah (community) across the world and jihadi organizations can exploit it."  Trump famously called for a total ban on Muslim immigration into the US during his campaign in response to the wave of terrorist attacks in America. While that call mysteriously disappeared then reappeared on the president-elect's campaign website last week—suggesting it may be another promise Trump could revise—analysts say those comments alone are enough ammo for jihadist propagandists.  Islamists sympathizers seem to agree. "Congratulations to the Muslim nation over the infidel Trump's victory. His stupid statements alone serve us," one Algerian ISIS supporter claimed on Twitter.
