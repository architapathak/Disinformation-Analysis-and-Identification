The fallout and reactions from the 2016 U.S. presidential election continue to unfold. In one bit of good news, Portland-producer Eprom announced a new initiative to support Planned Parenthood which comes under threat with the new Republican cabinet, House, Senate and President. "All the music on my Bandcamp is now pay what you want. All the proceeds from now until 2017 will be donated to Planned Parenthood," the producer wrote on his Facebook page. Available Eprom releases include Halflife, Metahuman, and the Samurai EP. Eprom's Bandcamp is available here. In 2015, we looked at Eprom's newish label, Sister City Limited.
