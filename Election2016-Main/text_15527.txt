Donald Trump's presidency is already good for business ... especially businesses with the moniker, "Trump." There has been a surge of interest in Trump real estate, according to our survey of NYC brokers. The agents say there was some fear before the election ... the Trump name would scare buyers away, but that was a miscalculation tied to some wonky poll numbers. One agent -- Gilad Azaria -- has 7 listings in Trump buildings, and since the election he's had 4 "serious buyers" in the $3 million range. He also says 2 of his clients who already live in Trump properties want to trade up in the same buildings to more expensive places. The agents with whom we spoke say the Trump properties are top quality, and the brand is now stronger than ever. Celeb agents Josh and Matt Altman say it's a no-brainer ... living in a building owned by the president is awesome ... and a super good investment.
