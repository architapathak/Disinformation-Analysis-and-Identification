Former Daily Show host and pro wrestling heel Jon Stewart spoke to CBS's Charlie Rose on Thursday morning about Trump, the current state of the country, and why liberals should stop assuming all Trump voters are racists.  Stewart, who has been relatively quiet over the course of the 2016 election season—save for a few surprise cameos on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert—was on CBS This Morning to promote a new oral history of The Daily Show, but the conversation inevitably focused less on the book and more on the political climate.  While Stewart was "surprised" by the election results, he makes it clear that America is still the same as it was before November 8.  "I don't believe we are a fundamentally different country today than we were two weeks ago," he told Rose. "The same country with all its grace and flaws, and volatility, and insecurity, and strength, and resilience exists today as it existed two weeks ago. The same country that elected Donald Trump elected Barack Obama. I feel badly for the people for whom this election will mean more uncertainty and insecurity. But I also feel like this fight has never been easy."  Stewart cautioned against liberals who made blanket assumptions that all Trump supporters were xenophobic racists. "There are guys in my neighborhood that I love, that I respect, that I think have incredible qualities who are not afraid of Mexicans, and not afraid of Muslims, and not afraid of blacks," he continued. "They're afraid of their insurance premiums."  Watch the full interview above.
