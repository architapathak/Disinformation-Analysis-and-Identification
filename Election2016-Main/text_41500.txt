The winter holiday season is upon us. Not convinced? Stop reading that Trump think piece and check out Google Trends. Every year, searches for key Christmas, Hanukkah and other holiday season touchstones begin their uptick in late October. That slope has solidly begun, per usual, well before Thanksgiving. Some of it even started before Halloween. Google Trends keeps a record of all search terms and their frequency of use. As we get closer to the holiday season and Dec. 25, you can see the little annual slope of searches begin to start their frustratingly early surge.  Holiday songs, Christmas trees and Hanukkah searches have officially begun. And maybe we need that cheer after this incredibly stressful election.Hold your reindeer, er horses, people. Black Friday searches have started, but at least that's only a few weeks away. Corporate Christmas always wins, doesn't it? But there's no forgiving the Christmas songs. We've barely tucked away our Halloween decorations, and I don't see snow on the ground. It's time to buckle down with some Leonard Cohen, not Mariah Carey. Bah, humbug.
