Donald Trump's gripe that the election is riddled with voter fraud might bear some truth in SoCal -- more than 1,100 dead people are still registered to vote ... according to a report. KCBS-LA Investigative Reporter David Goldstein ran a story Monday night revealing 265 corpses voted in Ventura, San Bernardino, Orange, Riverside and L.A. counties over the last 8 years -- most recently, in June's primary. According to the report, SoCal voting records also show more than 900 other dead people are still registered to vote this Election Day, but it appears no one's voted on their behalf. L.A. County Registrar's Dean Logan insists no dead people have voted on his watch.
