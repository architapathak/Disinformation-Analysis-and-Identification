Mike Pence's DC neighbors are trolling him with gay pride flags, ABC 7 reports . The former Indiana governor is currently living in a temporary residence in DC's Chevy Chase neighborhood before he moves into the official VP pad at the US Naval Observatory. When Pence—who has backed numerous anti-LGBTQ policies and once said that gay marriage would lead to "societal collapse"—moved into the northwest Washington neighborhood after the election, the gay pride flags began appearing at nearby houses as a subtle protest. Residents on NW Washington Street where VP Elect Pence is renting a house are sending him a symbolic message. More residents may hang flags — Suzanne Kennedy (@ABC7Suzanne)November 30, 2016 Flying the pride flag is "a respectful message showing, in my case, my disagreement with some of his thinking," Ilse Heintzen, who lives on Pence's block, told ABC 7. "I have no idea what [Pence] will think about, but I hope he will change his mind." According to the news report, there are six pride flags flying up and down the street, and more on their way. In other Pence trolling news, Planned Parenthood reported to have received more than 70,000 donations in the soon-to-be-VP's name since November 8.
