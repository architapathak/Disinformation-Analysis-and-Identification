After that election, the entire country needs to unwind. With the ever-expanding cannabis market comes more innovation, more ways to smoke weed, more ways to spend money on it, and, as shown in this video, more ways to waste it. Okay, these guys didn't actually waste their weed, but they do have enough of it to roll their joints in extra bud. That's just one of the ways they've built what they call the "most expensive joints ever." In this video by 420 Science Club, a YouTube channel dedicated to weed content, Brett Bohn from EvoLab, a Colorado-based cannabis extraction company, discusses products that could be used to make a joint as expensive as possible. Two of those products are Chroma, a purified cannabinoid distillate, and FreshTerps, an extract that captures the entire terpene profile of a strain of cannabis. Terpenes are the chemicals found in cannabis that provide its aroma and flavor, and they may also add to the plant's medicinal properties. More than 200 terpenes comprise the profile of a single strain of cannabis. Using a dropper, the 420 Science Club guys add $155 worth of Fresh Terps (about half a gram's worth) to fresh bud before rolling it all up into a joint. They make several joints, and on top of that, proceed to roll the joints in ground up flower—similar to sushi rolls that have rice on the outside. That's a lot of weed, and a lot of money spent on it, making it perhaps one of the most expensive joints out there—and among the most flavorful. "It's like the flavor powder on chips," says one guy. "My mouth tastes like I'm dabbing and smoking a joint at the same time." Get six of our favorite Motherboard stories every day by signing up for our newsletter.
