The Dallas Morning News published an editorial Wednesday morning endorsing Hillary Clinton for president. It's the first time the newspaper has supported a Democratic candidate since before World War II.  "Résumé vs. résumé, judgment vs. judgment, this election is no contest," the editorial board writes, calling Trump's values "hostile to conservatism."  "He plays on fear—exploiting base instincts of xenophobia, racism, and misogyny—to bring out the worst in all of us, rather than the best," the op-ed continues. "His serial shifts on fundamental issues reveal an astounding absence of preparedness. And his improvisational insults and midnight tweets exhibit a dangerous lack of judgment and impulse control."  Though the editorial acknowledges Clinton's "real shortcomings"—particularly her "poor judgment" regarding the use of a private email server while serving as secretary of state—Clinton "is the candidate more likely to keep our nation safe, to protect American ideals, and to work across the aisle to uphold the vital domestic institutions that rely on a competent, experienced president."  The Morning News is another in a line of publications and right-wing officials to throw their weight behind Clinton—though Trump still has the National Enquirer's vote, for what it's worth.
