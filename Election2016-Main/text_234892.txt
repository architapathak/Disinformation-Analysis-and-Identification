On Sunday, the New York Timesreported that Trump's campaign staff has taken over control of the GOP candidate's Twitter account so that he can't go on any late-night rants during the last few hours of the 2016 election season. President Obama found the news pretty funny, especially since he will be handing over the @POTUS Twitter account to Trump if the election goes Donald's way on Tuesday. "Apparently his campaign has taken away his Twitter," the president said at a Clinton rally in Florida. "In the last two days, they had so little confidence in his self-control, they said: 'We're just going to take away your Twitter.' Now, if somebody can't handle a Twitter account, they can't handle the nuclear code." Trump's staffers are currently keeping his feed pretty blandâ€”over the last few days, the former reality star's usual hateful Twitter screeds have been replaced by some generic, spammy tweets about getting out the vote. Since Trump's not at the helm of his account anymore, we won't know what kind of vitriolic thing he might have to say in response to Obama's dig. But judging by Trump's archive of tweets about Obama, he'd probably toss out a line about how there won't be another black president for generations or something.
