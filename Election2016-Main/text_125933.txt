You're about to see yet another political ad in your Facebook feed. This video features a somber Jesse Williams of Grey's Anatomy fame explaining why voting is so important. It will be the second one written and directed by Joss Whedon and distributed by his one-month old Save the Day super PAC. Whedon is known more for directing blockbusters than political ads, but for the last six weeks of the election, expect him to use one million dollars, his humor and deep celebrity rolodex to try to flood social media channels with 2016 videos. The first video dropped late last week and featured everyone from Robert Downey Jr. and Scarlett Johnaseen to, well, Whedon's maid. The ad, titled "Important," promised that if people did show up at the polls, actor Mark Ruffalo would do a nude scene in his next movie. Humorous, yes, but Whedon is serious about this. VICE News caught up with him in new York City.
