About 1,500 students at the diverse California school left their classrooms early in the day, using Instagram and Snapchat to organize. Trump’s election means that he could swiftly undo several years of legislation, including Obama’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which was passed as an executive action. DACA gave temporary protection to the children of immigrants born in the U.S. Students brought signs and microphones to demonstrate against Trump’s language and divisive plans. They said they were doing what they can until the next election, when those of age will be able to cast their first ballots.
