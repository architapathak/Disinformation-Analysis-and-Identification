Hillary Clinton said goodbye to her presidential hopes Wednesday, but the silver lining is her campaign merchandise is selling like crazy. A source at the official Hillary for America online store tells TMZ ... she's been flooded all morning with hundreds of orders for gear. Our source believes collectors are trying to scoop up the last of the commemorative merchandise, and supplies are extremely limited. Normally, they have 50 types of shirts, but now there are only 3 left. One of 'em is only available in XS ... so, there ya go skinny chicks, and there was only ONE Hillary logo hat left! We're told staffers are shocked after Tuesday night's results. They did have several order cancellations early in the day, and expected that trend to continue all day, but much like the election ... they experienced a dramatic swing. It's all going cheap too -- a button's going for $4 bucks, and it's free shipping on any order over $30. Sometimes losing pays too.
