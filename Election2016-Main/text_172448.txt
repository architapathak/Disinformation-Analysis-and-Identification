The morning after Brexit, on June 24, I interviewed Adam Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, about the referendum's likely impact on the United Kingdom and beyond. His assessment of the global political and economic implications looks rather prescient just a few months later, and is worth revisiting following the election of Donald Trump to the U.S. presidency. This is how Posen, a former member of the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee, answered my question on what Brexit represented: "It is very frightening. It's an analogy which I used before the vote, which unfortunately I think is valid, which is, you had Mussolini come to power with the fascists in 1920s Italy. And he did some nasty things but he didn't do what we all now recognize as terrible, so that gave some legitimacy to frankly, explicitly, to Hilter's election campaigns in 1930 and 1933. That a. you could vote for such a person, b. that such a person had a chance of winning and c. it seemed at least it seemed initially that it wouldn't be the end of the world if you voted for a person like that. "So I fear that this success in electoral terms for the Leave campaign in Britain will create similar legitimization, whether it's for Marie Le-Pen and the Front Nacional in France, which is a racist anti-Europe movement, their counterparts in Poland and Hungary, the horrible people in Greece who are beating up foreigners, and then of course for some of the supporters of Mr. Trump in the U.S." Check out the full interview below:
