Read: A Brief History of Embarrassing Attempts to Get the Youth to Vote Avengers director Joss Whedon corralled a bunch of famous celebrities into one room to shamelessly remind viewers to register to vote—and try to encourage people not to vote for Trump, while they're at it. In the PSA, the all-star cast—including Julianne Moore, Robert Downey Jr., Scarlett Johansson, and Neil Patrick Harris, among others—say, "You only get this many famous people together if the issue is one that truly matters to all of us."
