This week felt like a fever dream or many Americans, and sometimes the best way to alleviate anxiety is to distract our brains by learning something new. To help aid your post-election blues, we've gathered a handful of recent documentaries across the VICE channels, from a look at a seed vault that could be humanity's saving grace in the event of a global catastrophe to a MUNCHIES tutorial on how to make the dankest lamb salad you've ever tasted. Re-visit these docs below, and stay tuned for new videos next week. And to watch even more VICE documentaries, visit our new video hosting site here. On this episode of 'Daily VICE,' we head to the The Psychobilly Meeting in Spain to talk with the fans of a genre that combines elements of punk, rock, and B-movie trash culture. As the US Men's National Team in soccer prepared to play arch-rival Mexico in Columbus, Ohio, Roger Bennett of NBC Sports Network's "Men In Blazers" went to Dortmund to meet Christian Pulisic and his family to uncover the factors that have propelled his dizzying, unprecedented rise. To celebrate the launch of WAYPOINT, VICE's new gaming website, we decided to do a massive, 72 hour long livestream over Halloween weekend. Over the course of three full days, we played 72 of our favorite (and least favorite) games, were joined by old friends and surprise guests, and encountered some spooky apparitions in the VICE offices.
