It's November, the regular season is winding down and we are starting to get a true picture of what the 2016-2017 bowl lineup will look like. Although nothing major has changed from last week's projections, there's still plenty of room for movement in the weeks to come, especially among the mid-tier bowls where there has been a lot of shuffling. The bowl selection process has changed in the past three years, with the advent of the College Football Playoff and New Year's Six bowls, and conferences now have a greater say in the bowl pecking order than they did before. The top four teams go to the Playoff, regardless of conference, and the remaining New Year's Six bowls are filled out with conference tie-ins and at-large bids. All bowls have conference tie-ins, but those are broken when conferences can't fill all of their slots. Here's a good look at the tie-in and selection process. Teams have to be at least 6-6 to make a bowl, but if there aren't enough 6-6 teams to fill all of the slots, 5-7 teams are selected based on their Academic Progress Rate.
