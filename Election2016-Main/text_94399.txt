Sergio Perez has tweeted that he will ditch sunglasses brand Hawkers as a sponsor after a controversial comment it made regarding Donald Trump. The Mexican F1 star took exception to a tweet from the official Hawkers account, intended to be light-hearted, which suggested that Mexican citizens could use its glasses to not show their 'crying eyes tomorrow when you are building the wall'. In the wake of Trump's controversial comments regarding the US/Mexican border and his shock win in the US election, Perez wasted little time responding to the tweet, claiming he will end his relationship with Hawkers. "Really bad comment," he tweeted. "Today I am breaking my relationship with @HawkersMX. I will never let anyone make fun of my country." The relationship between Perez and Hawkers is only weeks old, the brand having released it's Perez-edition glasses on November 2 for a price of 725 Mexican pesos (approximately US$39).
