Some of the biggest music industry organizations in the U.S. penned a letter to Donald Trump yesterday ahead of his scheduled meetings with tech industry leaders like Apple CEO Tim Cook, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, Amazon's Jeff Bezos, and Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg. In the letter, nineteen organizations including ASCAP, BMI, RIAA, and The Songwriters Guild of America congratulated president-elect Trump before urging that he enforce intellectual property laws.  "Congratulations on your election to serve as the 45th President of the United States," the letter opens. "We look forward to working with you and your Administration on behalf of American music—one of our nation's most valuable forms of art and intellectual property, and a powerful driver of high-quality U.S. jobs and exports."  The letter quotes a stand that Trump took on intellectual property over the summer in which he said: "Intellectual property is a driving force in today's global economy of constant innovation. It is the wellspring of American economic growth and job creation. With the rise of the digital economy, it has become even more critical that we protect intellectual property rights and preserve freedom of contract rather than create regulatory barriers to creativity, growth, and innovation."
