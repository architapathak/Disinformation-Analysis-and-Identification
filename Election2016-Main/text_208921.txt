This past Friday, avant-garde icon Yoko Ono took to Twitter share an audio response to the election of Donald Trump, emitting a 19-second scream that has since gone viral. Now Trax Couture label boss Rushmore has given this screech of resistance new life by editing it into a club track called "Yoko Riddim," releasing it this morning and making it available for free download. Where Ono's original sounds simultaneously full of despair and ready to fight, here it is chopped up and edited almost like a chant, paired with a beat that oozes ballroom swagger. It's true that the result isn't exactly an anthem of rebellion, but Rushmore has previously made his position on Trump clear, adding his voice to the legion of electronic musicians speaking out in opposition to his election. Last week, Berlin-via-Houston producer Lotic shared a seething, "ELECTION ANXIETY/AMERICA IS OVER" edit of Beyonc√©'s "Formation," while Chicago DJ The Black Madonna wrote an essay in response to the election, telling the businessman-turned-politician: "You will not stop us."
