Despite all the chaos and anger surrounding this election season, and regardless of what you hope the outcome will be, it is pretty fucking cool that today women around the country—who didn't have the right to vote until 1920—are going to head to the polls and cast their ballot for the first female presidential candidate. And many of those women have already celebrated the occasion by heading over to Mount Hope Cemetery in Rochester, New York, to thank one woman who fought tirelessly for this whole thing to eventually happen: Susan B. Anthony. All day Tuesday, local CBS News station WROC is broadcasting live on Facebook from Anthony's grave, where men and women have come to slap down their "I Voted" stickers on the activist's headstone. By the afternoon, people were forming lines just to take a photo by the marker, which now boasts a giant mound of flowers at its base. In addition to founding feminist newspaper the Revolution with Elizabeth Cady Stanton in 1868, Anthony stood before all the men in Congress and asked them to consider granting women the right to vote every single year from 1869 to 1906. Fourteen years later, after her death, they finally did and rightly nicknamed the 19th Amendment after her. Anthony's not the only suffragist getting some love this Election Day. According to the New York Times, a few people have also been visiting Stanton's grave in the Bronx, where she lays near a few other prominent activists who made strides in the women's suffragist movement.
