We're just days away from an election that could potentially (Hopefully!) bring the United States its first female president. If it does happen, this wouldn't be the first time we've seen a Madame President. In fact, pop culture has long been more progressive than our actual real-life country. In everything from sitcoms to action movies, the role of the leader of the free world has been filled by women for years. And in these fictional situations, there wasn't much fuss about the person being a woman. See, America?! It's not so hard!Here's a roundup of the times television and film beat our country to the punch. Kudos to these nasty women for being way ahead of their time. And fingers crossed that fiction will become reality on November 8!
