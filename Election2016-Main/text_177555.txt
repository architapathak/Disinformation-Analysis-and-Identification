We confronted Richard Spencer, the white nationalist known for using Nazi rallying cries  We confronted Richard Spencer, the white nationalist known for using Nazi rallying cries  This interview originally aired Dec. 5, 2016, on VICE News Tonight on HBO. Last month, video from a white nationalist conference in Washington, D.C., went viral. The annual event was put on by the National Policy Institute, and its president, Richard Spencer, was filmed telling attendees about what Donald Trump’s election victory meant for the so-called alt-right: that white people must “conquer or die.” Describing the United States as a nation that was “until this past generation a white country, designed for ourselves and our posterity,” Spencer concluded his remarks by declaring, “Hail Trump, hail our people, hail victory.” Some members of the audience responded with the Nazi salute. Credited with founding the term “alt-right” in 2008, Spencer advocates for a “white ethno-state on the North American continent” and giving up “the false dreams of equality and democracy.” These views resulted in a travel ban to the United Kingdom placed on Spencer by then-home secretary Theresa May. VICE News Tonight’s Elle Reeve met with Spencer shortly after the conference to discuss the rise of the alt-right and the role he’s played in it.
