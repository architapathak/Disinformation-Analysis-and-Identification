Donald Trump sat down with his wife, Melania, on Good Morning America to give their first joint interview since the release of the 2005 Access Hollywood tapes. They talked with former Bill Clinton advisor George Stephanopoulos, and Trump was shocked he hadn't insulted the journalist yet on Twitter.  After Stephanopoulos asked the couple about Trump's comments on the leaked tapes, the host brought up the sprawling two-page spread of the Republican nominee's Twitter insults that the New York Times published in print over the weekend.  "Were you one of them?" Trump asked Stephanopoulos.  "Actually, I wasn't," the host replied. "I was a little surprised at that." Trump then said he couldn't believe Stephanopoulos didn't make the cut of the 282 people, places, and things he's thrown jabs at on Twitter throughout the election. "Oh, well, you should have been," Trump responded. "I'm surprised. Let's go check it. I can't believe I didn't include you." Trump also had a surprise of his own: He let his wife know, seemingly for the first time, that she'll be making a few more speeches before Election Day. "Oh!" Melania exclaimed next to her husband.  "She's agreed to do two or three speeches, and I think it's going to be big speeches, important speeches," Trump said, apparently unaware of Melania's bewilderment. "She's an amazing public speaker."  Read: Trump Campaign Admitted Yeah, OK, Maybe It Did Plagiarize Michelle Obama's Speech
