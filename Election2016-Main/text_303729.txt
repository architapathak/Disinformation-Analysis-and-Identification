On Monday, ten members of the Electoral College wrote a letter to national intelligence director James Clapper asking for an intelligence briefing regarding any ongoing investigations into foreign election interference. Now 54 of the 232 Democrat electors—and one Republican—have reportedly joined in on that request, according to Politico. The list now holds signatures from 13 states, the majority of which come from electors in California, New York, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire. But despite the request gaining ground—and support from the Clinton campaign—it still lacks the names of key electors like Bill Clinton, Andrew Cuomo, and Bill de Blasio from New York. In the letter, the electors argue that they need information regarding various election hacks—believed by the CIA to have come from Russia—before they meet and cast the official presidential vote on December 19. The letter cites concerns about Donald Trump's current handling of intelligence findings and his ongoing defense of Russian president Vladimir Putin. "The Electors require to know from the intelligence community whether there are ongoing investigations into ties between Donald Trump, his campaign, or associates, and Russian government interference in the election, the scope of those investigations, how far those investigations may have reached, and who was involved in those investigations," the letter reads. "We further require a briefing on all investigative findings, as these matters directly impact the core factors in our deliberations of whether Mr. Trump is fit to serve as President of the United States."
