The character Terry Tate—played by Lester Speight, and famous for the Office Linebacker Reebok ads during Super Bowl XXXVII—made a comeback with Funny or Die on Friday by appearing in a doctored-up version of Trump's infamous Access Hollywood video. In it, he tackles the shit out of Trump, saying, "That's how Terry Tate makes America great, baby!" And it is simply the most satisfying thing you will see this fall. The whole thing starts up with the nightmare/cringe-inducing audio of Trump talking about grabbing women "by the pussy" and being able to do "anything" to women because he's a "star"—which only gets harder to listen to each time. But mercifully in this edition, at the end of his and Billy Bush's disgusting forced-hug session on the soap opera star Arianne Zucker, instead of going backstage, Donald looks off into the space between and gets absolutely lit up by Terry Tate. (With silky-smooth editing, btw.) Then, after actually making America great by wrecking Trump, Tate yells, "You can't go around grabbing people willy-nilly, son! That's just creepy." An understatement, if there ever was one. Then Tate adds, "what kind of locker rooms you been hanging out in, Donny, huh?" It is cathartic for the collective unconscious of America in a way that I can't even describe, watching Trump get rocketed through the air, and into the side of his sexual-assault-talk/safe-space vehicle, limp and soulless as the fuck puppet that he is. And just when you thought that Billy Bush was off the hook, Tate follows up by saying, "Hey, Billy Bush," with a smile that quickly drops to a grimace. "You're fired." Tate tackling Trump mid-sexual-assault-promotion-interview is the only kind of revisionist history that should be allowed this election. Oh, and in case it's hard for you to listen to Trump say those horrible things over and over again, I've provided a gif of just the tackle and cowering for you: You're welcome.
