Tila Tequila is back at it again with the gross anti-Semitism.When Sarah Silverman tweeted a response to Trump's election, Tequila had a pretty deplorable response. "Go back to Israel!" the 35-year-old tweeted. Tequila's anti-Semitism isn't entirely surprising. And she has targeted Silverman in the past: In June 2016, Tequila tweeted that "[Silverman] and her people killed [Jesus]." The reality TV personality also used the neo-Nazi echo symbol, which is how many neo-Nazis identify Jewish users online, according to The Jerusalem Post. Tequila's words are also in line with sentiments expressed by the Trump campaign, which at times relied on overt anti-Semitic imagery. In July, the president-elect tweeted an anti-Hillary Clinton meme that reportedly originated on a white supremacist message board. In the words of the prophet Joanne the Scammer: "That's over, it's canceled." Sorry, Tila Tequila but try your trolling on someone else.
