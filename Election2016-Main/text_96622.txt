It's been almost a week since the election, and many of us have been fruitlessly searching anywhere we can for just a modicum of solace, but there's been no escaping the crushing fist of reality. So with the apocalypse less than three months away, we offer you one more place to look for comfort: at the bottom of that little blue box of Kraft macaroni and cheese. There's just something about the mix of childhood nostalgia and nuclear orange faux-cheese powder that soothes the soul. But here at MUNCHIES, we believe that even the best guilty-pleasure comfort foods can always be made better with a little bit of love. So we added a healthy dose of amor, along a shit ton of butter, heavy cream, and honest-to-goodness cheese—including fontina, cheddar, and gruyère—along with that day-glow orange powder. And yes, you'll be putting this fancy AF mac in a casserole dish and throwing it in the oven until golden brown, because there's no such thing as too much comfort at a time like this. So put on a onesie, go find your Snuggie, and crank up the Justin Bieber or turn on an episode of The Bachelor. Then dig in and enjoy the End of Days in the coziest way possible—and apologize to no one.
