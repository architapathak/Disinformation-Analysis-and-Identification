Last week, while the country somehow decided that Donald Trump should be the Leader of the Free World, four states voted to legalize recreational marijuana. Now, Denver, Colorado, has taken another big step toward marijuana reform: The city passed a new law that will allow people to get stoned as hell in some of its bars and restaurants. The Associated Press reports that the law doesn't mean you can just spark a one-hitter next to the ma√Ætre d' like some stoner version of Don Draper. Smoking inside is still illegal, and bar and restaurant owners will have to apply for a permit before people can suck on weed lollipops or whatever in their establishment. If you want to smoke, the law will allow for outdoor blazing sections, if they adhere to specific guidelines.  "It's the sensible thing to do," Emmett Reistroffer, a marijuana consultant who worked to get the bill passed, told AP. "This is about personal responsibility and respecting adults who want to have a place to enjoy cannabis."  Denver citizens voted on the law during the election, but the decision was so close and contested that it has taken a week for the votes to be fully tallied. Denver is now the first city in the nation to allow people to use marijuana in participating bars and eateries.  Watch: How to Make a Pipe Out of a Banana
