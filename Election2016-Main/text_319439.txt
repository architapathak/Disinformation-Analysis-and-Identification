The defining feature throughout is minimalistic restraint, as well as recurring motifs of dubbed-out synth swells and eerie arpeggiated figures; he even finds room to slip in a breakbeat at one point without upsetting the ambiance. Introducing his work at the beginning of the broadcast, he says that "the idea behind the mix was to do a condensed version of a longer set I might play in a club." His selections include music from a handful of producers he describes as some of his favorite artists, including Baikal, Barnt, and Roman Fl√ºgel, alongside exclusive tracks from fellow Maeve co-founder The Drifter and more. You can hear it in full over on the BBC's website. Seth Troxler recorded his third Essential mix live in Brooklyn last month at Williamsburg's Output club. Meanwhile, at the beginning of 2016 we chronicled the 12 most essential Essential Mixes of the 90s and early 2000s. Follow Alexander on Twitter.
