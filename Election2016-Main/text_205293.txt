President Obama echoed Hillary Clinton's words, and said he would ensure a smooth transition of power to President-elect Donald Trump. With Vice President Joe Biden by his side, POTUS said of the election ... "The day after we have to remember we're all on one team. We're Americans first, we're patriots first." He also discussed his phone call to Trump last night and why he felt encouraged by what he heard. They're scheduled to meet face-to-face on Thursday. There was a lighthearted moment between the Prez and VP where Barack talked about having lost elections, while Biden had not. Check out Biden's reaction. #BosomBuddies
