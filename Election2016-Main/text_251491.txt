After partial vote recounts in certain states, US election officials found no evidence that votes had been manipulated by a cyberattack on voting machines, security researchers told an audience at the Chaos Communication Congress hacking festival on Wednesday. But the researchers called for a vast overhaul in voting machine security and related legislation, warning that an attack is still possible in a future election. "We need this because even if the 2016 election wasn't hacked, the 2020 election might well be," said J. Alex Halderman, a professor of computer science at the University of Michigan, during a presentation with Matt Bernhard, a computer science PhD student. Halderman's and other security experts' concerns made headlines in November when he participated in a call with the Clinton campaign about a potential recount in some states. Green Party candidate Jill Stein subsequently held a crowdfunding campaign to finance the recounts. "Developing an attack for one of these machines is not terribly difficult; I and others have done it again and again in the laboratory. All you need to do is buy one government surplus on eBay to test it out," Halderman, who has extensively researched voting machine security, said during the talk. Read the rest on Motherboard
