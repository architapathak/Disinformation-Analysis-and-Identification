The creative outlets available to survive high school can play out through multiple channels: angsty garage rock, poetry slams, class office elections, or giant parking space murals. Similar to the teenage pastime and viral-news-in-waiting, prom proposals (“promposals”), the ritual of painting parking spaces at a handful of US high schools now marks a vital senior year activity before college and the real world enter the picture. The parking spot mural tradition offers a unique canvas for young artists (who just got their license!) and meme-obsessed jokesters to embellish one of the few objects of high school ownership. Notable high schools involved in the artistic and internet-loved murals range from Sicklerville, New Jersey, Chelsea, Alabama, Georgetown, Texas, West Orange, Florida, among other cities. Like clockwork, these students will paint their parking lots every year, accumulating many hours that were also matched in studying, we would guess.
