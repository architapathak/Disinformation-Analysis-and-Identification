Kellyanne Conway, Donald Trump's former campaign manager and one of his most outspoken allies, has accepted a White House position as counselor to the president, the New York Times reports. The cabinet position makes Conway the highest-ranking female member of Trump's new administration. As counselor, she'll have close access to the president and will be tasked with helping his administration carry out his top priorities and effectively deliver his political message. "Kellyanne Conway has been a trusted advisor and strategist who played a crucial role in my victory," the president-elect said in a statement. "She is a tireless and tenacious advocate of my agenda and has amazing insights on how to effectively communicate our message." As the first female campaign manager to win a presidential election, Conway quickly became a member of Trump's inner circle. She's made many TV appearances in an effort to smooth over some of Trump's bumpier moments on the campaign trail, defending him even after the release of the infamous Access Hollywood tapes. On CNN's New Day, she told host Chris Cuomo that she'd be using some of her experience as a spokeswoman and background as a pollster in her new role.  "It is likely to include communications, and is likely to include data and strategy," she said Thursday. "I'm just really pleased and frankly very humbled to take on this role in the West Wing."
