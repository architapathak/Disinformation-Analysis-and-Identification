As I mentioned on the podcast that week, the conference was a godsend—an inclusive, positive, important event for LGBTQI folks who were reeling especially from the week's election results. Game critic, writer, and scholar Katherine Cross closed out the event with a rousing speech. Literally rousing, as there was a standing ovation to her talk on the need for art, community, and play even more during difficult times.  The text of her remarks is available over at Black Nerd Girls. Please take a look at it, let those words sink in if you need an iota of hope without any Pollyanna hand-waving. There is power in art, and even more in community—and the importance in watching out for one another and banding together, even in the spirit of fun.  From Cross' speech: Disclosure notice: Cross is a personal friend of mine, as are several GaymerX staff.
