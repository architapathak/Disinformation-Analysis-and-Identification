On Wednesday morning, a guy disguised as a city worker showed up to Trump's star on the Walk of Fame in Hollywood armed with a sledgehammer and thoroughly trashed the thing, Deadline reports. Trump was awarded the star in 2007 for his role on The Apprentice, and it's been the target of multiple vandals over the course of the GOP candidate's presidential bid, but Walk of Fame officials have always been able to restore it to its original state. This time, there's not much left to restore. The incident was caught on camera around 5:45 AM and released by Deadline. In it, the perp—who later told Deadline his name was Jamie Otis—is shown inside a perimeter of traffic cones, just mercilessly laying into the star. He eventually managed to smash the star into bits and pry it from the sidewalk, leaving only a dirt outline. He was gone by the time police showed up at 6:15 AM. Otis told Deadline that he plans to auction off the pieces to support Trump's numerous sexual assault accusers, who Trump has threatened to sue after the election is over. Otis has not yet been arrested, though police told the Los Angeles Times that the stunt is considered felony vandalism. Maybe he should have just puked all over the star, instead. UPDATE 10/27/2016: The LAPD has confirmed that it has a suspect in custody, according to Entertainment Weekly. Trump's star has since been rebuilt.
