Cedric the Entertainer has an important message to any would-be violent protesters out there -- just don't. We caught up with the comedian Tuesday in Bev Hills and he weighed in on the countrywide protests against Donald Trump's election win. Cedric's crystal clear -- it's ok to be angry but there's a limit. #DontBeAFool
