Garth Brooks was radio silent on who he supported during the election, but he's definitely down with singing for President Trump at his inauguration. We got Garth at the XMAS tree lighting Wednesday in D.C. and he's all about duty, honor country. BTW ... who do you think Garth believes is the best songwriter around? It's not a country songwriter ... not even close.
