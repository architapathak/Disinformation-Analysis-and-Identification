Donald Trump is the next president of the United States. There's no denying that. But there's still one burning question that a solid portion of the public have: How could this even happen?  On Wednesday's episode of VICELAND's Desus & Mero, the two hosts broke it down for us. Apparently when you mix Trump's silent supporters (shout out to conservative white women), the electoral college, and voter apathy, you find yourself with the Trump in the Oval Office.  Desus and Mero also brought out activist and educator DeRay Mckesson to further dissect this election and, ultimately, our country's future under President Trump. Watch that below.
