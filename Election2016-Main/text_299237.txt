In case you haven't heard the word, our series Bong Appetit is moving to VICELAND, where you'll be able to catch our host Abdullah Saeed eating, drinking, and smoking his way to culinary bliss with the people who best know the most delicious ways to get high on both life and marijuana. Abdullah and his team throw the world's most elaborate cannabis dinner parties, inviting notable chefs to come and create a meal in a kitchen stocked with the biggest selection of marijuana ingredients ever assembled. Want a sneak peek of tonight's episode? Abdullah learns how to make weed wine and invites chef Marcel Vigneron—Top Chef alum and owner of Los Angeles restaurants Wolf and Beefsteak—to prepare cannabutter-basted beef cheek, weed-smoked tuna, and potleaf juice 'Dippin' Dots.' VICELAND's Bong Appetit airs Wednesdays at 10:30 PM. Get the cable hookup or catch all our shows on the VICELAND app.
