In Elizabeth Warren's first interview since Hillary Clinton's election loss, she told MSNBC's Rachel Maddow that she's willing to set aside all of Donald Trump's hateful Twitter insults and get back to work in Washington. "If Donald Trump will advance the kinds of policies, the kinds of measures that can be helpful, then man let's jump up and work with him. Let's make that happen because these are things, not just that Democrats want, these are things that Americans want," Warren said Thursday. The Massachusetts senator said that there were some policy areas where the two potentially overlap—social security, raising the minimum wage, paid family leave, and economic recovery—but she was worried about how his presidency could affect the Affordable Care Act, Roe v. Wade, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. "There are things we're going to end up losing, because we don't have the White House, we don't have the Senate, we don't have the House of Representatives," Warren said of the Democratic party. "But on those core issues about treating every single human being in this country with dignity, on that we stand up and we fight back. We do not back down. We do not compromise, not today, not tomorrow, not ever." The senator also offered some suggestions for ways people around the country can fight back. "Volunteer with Planned Parenthood, or with any other organization that really matters to you. Volunteering is a way to say, 'We're making these groups stronger. This is one way our voice will be heard,'" she said. "We've got to stay connected to each other. We have to talk about issues and fights that are coming up because we have to be ready to mobilize on certain issues when the time comes." Watch: VICE News Checked in with America After Trump's Win
