Two of New Jersey governor Chris Christie's former aides were found guilty Friday for their involvement in the Bridgegate scandal, the New York Timesreports. The Christie allies, Bridget Anne Kelly and Bill Baroni, were originally indicted in 2015 on charges including conspiracy and wire fraud. The pair were party to a shutdown of busy lanes on the George Washington Bridge, causing massive gridlock, apparently as retribution against the mayor of Fort Lee, New Jersey, for not endorsing Christie's 2013 reelection. The crimes carry a maximum prison sentence of 20 years, though prosecutors have made clear they won't seek anything near that long. Christie himself was not charged, but the ongoing scandal helped poison his run for the presidency, and multiple pieces of testimony during the trial suggested he was aware of the conspiracy while it was happening.  Christie will be in New Hampshire and Pennsylvania this weekend, stumping for Donald Trump before Tuesday's election. Read: Chris Christie Wants America to Apologize to Him for Bridgegate
