Yes, we're aware that Thanksgiving is next week. But that's the key to a bitchin' Thanksgiving: planning ahead. And it's been a hell of a year, so it's time to relax, unwind, and celebrate the day to be thankful will all of your friends (and some family members)â€”or at least the ones you didn't defriend from Facebook during election season. After all, wouldn't it be great to wake up on Thanksgiving morning to the wails of your hungover cousins from Tulsa in the guest bedroom and know that you already have three incredible pies waiting in the fridge? How about the promise of zero stress over whether you'll once again overcook the Friendsgiving turkey to the point of inedibility? And if you don't make it to the supermarkets before they close at 4 PM, wouldn't you feel better knowing that you have all of the necessary cocktail components for boozing up Aunt Doris before she starts nagging you about why you're not married? For both emotional support and general festivity, The MUNCHIES Guide to Friendsgiving is your go-to resource for delicious and depraved food stories from chefs, bartenders, and other voices of the food world all week.
