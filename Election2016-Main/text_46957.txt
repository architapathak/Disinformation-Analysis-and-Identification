A photo posted by Liana finck (@lianafinck) on  The charm of Liana Finck’s discordant cartoons isn’t in their form, or attention to detail, but in their ability to tease our society’s anxieties in a direct and constructive manner. Her illustrations are composed in the abrupt lackadaisical style of a children’s drawing but explore very adult issues and scenarios. Finck—whose work has been featured in the well-known publications like The New Yorker —doesn’t always consider politics in her work, but when she does, she hits the nail of the head. On Friday, she posted a Doomsday clock counting down the days until the election, and later posted this rickety image of Uncle Sam saying, “I want you deported.” Finck’s work often incorporates text into her drawings which she uses as a tool to insert sarcasm and wit into her stack scenes. Check out some more examples of her work below:   A photo posted by Liana finck (@lianafinck) on  A photo posted by Liana finck (@lianafinck) on  A photo posted by Liana finck (@lianafinck) on  A photo posted by Liana finck (@lianafinck) on  A photo posted by Liana finck (@lianafinck) on  A photo posted by Liana finck (@lianafinck) on   Be sure to check out more of Fink's work on her Instagram, and find your next favorite artist on The Creators Project's Instagram feed.
