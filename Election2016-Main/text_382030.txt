Anyone who's ever walked into an Anthropologie store knows that the brand kills it when it comes to colorful, cozy clothing and vintage-inspired home decor goods. With all the ornate door knobs, chunky sweaters, and pattern-crazy bedding that fill the place, it's plenty easy to overlook the beauty aisle. But it makes sense that Anthropologie's selection of beauty products is just as curated as everything else it carries. It turns out, an incredible array of beauty products lives within Anthropologie's shelves that perfectly complement the brand's aesthetic. So if you dig flapper-era-inspired lipstick packaging, top-selling cult name-brands, and eco-friendly nail polishes, we suggest you take a look at these offerings ASAP. At Refinery29, weâ€™re here to help you navigate this overwhelming world of stuff. All of our market picks are independently selected and curated by the editorial team.
