According to search data from Google, there's been a massive surge in searches relating to the Ku Klux Klan since Trump won the election, the Washington Post reports.  Apparently, more Americans scoured the internet for the infamous hooded racists this November than ever before. Google doesn't publish its numbers, but the mass of people searching for the KKK is right up there with the number of searches for the internet's longtime traffic barometer, Kim Kardashian.  The KKK has made a mainstream resurgence this year alongside Donald Trump's presidential run. Former Klan leader David Duke endorsed Trump back in February before launching his own bid for Senate. The group's official newspaper, the Crusader, aligned itself with Trump's views, and the KKK in North Carolina announced that it would be holding a victory parade in honor of the new president-elect in December.  Obviously it's not clear if the searches are born out of fear for the domestic hate group or out of interest in joining. Searches for "how to impeach a president" increased by 4,850 percent after Trump won, too, so that's something.  Watch: The Movement That's Fueling Donald Trump's White Nationalist Supporters
