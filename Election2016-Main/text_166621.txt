We're updating our bowl projections throughout rivalry weekend. Here's the update after the end of Saturday's games. The top four teams go to the Playoff, regardless of conference, and the remaining New Year's Six bowls are filled out with conference tie-ins and at-large bids. All bowls have conference tie-ins, but those are broken when conferences can't fill all of their slots. Here's a good look at the tie-in and selection process. Teams have to be at least 6-6 to make a bowl, but if there aren't enough 6-6 teams to fill all of the slots, 5-7 teams are selected based on their Academic Progress Rate. I'm projecting a whopping FIVE slots will be open for 5-7 teams. Those teams are marked with an asterisk.
