Hillary Clinton's election night event is worthy of presidential notice ... and the joint's in full construction mode. HC will be hosting a party of one sort or another at the Jacob Javits Center's Crystal Palace in NYC. Crews have already started building a stage, risers and stands for a huge audience. We're told she's renting section 3E of the Palace -- all 119,000 square feet of it. The floor dimensions are 456' x 286', with 33 foot high ceilings ... and an occupancy capped at 3,930. As of Friday, crews were also setting up the audio systems. Meanwhile, Donald Trump will be hosting his own election night shindig about 20 blocks uptown at the Hilton Midtown.
