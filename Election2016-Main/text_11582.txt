 The radical Pirate Party has made gains but not a breakthrough in Iceland's election, as voters gave the largest share of support to the incumbent center-right Independence Party. No party emerged with a decisive majority of Parliament seats, leaving the shape of the next government unclear. With most votes counted Sunday, the Independence Party had 29 percent support and the Pirate Party 14.5 percent, putting them in third place behind the Left-Green movement at 15.9 percent. The result leaves parliament split between parties of left and right. It wasn't clear whether the Independents will be able to assemble a coalition. Independence Party leader Bjarni Benediktsson said he was "extremely happy." Pirate lawmaker Birgitta Jonsdottir said the party was pleased to have tripled its vote share from the 2013 election.
