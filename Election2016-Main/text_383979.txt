The AP reports that Republicans won at least 218 seats by early Wednesday, November 9, to maintain control.Republicans have had a majority in the House since 2011. In the current 114th Congress, there are 246 Republican representatives to 186 Democrats (the House has three vacancies due to two resignations and a death). A party needs a majority of 218 of the 435 seats to have control of the house.The Republican victory means that the Speaker of the House gavel stays in the hands of Wisconsin Republican Paul Ryan.
