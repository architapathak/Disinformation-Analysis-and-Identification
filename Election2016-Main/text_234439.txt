Balancing on the cusp of a new millennium, the show, It Was a New Century: Reflections on Modern America, brings in distinct creatives from the epoch, including George Bellows, Childe Hassam, Winslow Homer, and Maurice Prendergast. For many of the artists, the city of New York and the political and cultural climate surrounding the turn of the century influenced their work's subject matter. George Bellow's intense, roughly-hewn depictions of boxing played a part in categorizing the School's perspective. The underbelly-located energy of Bellow's portraits contrast with the metropolis watercolors by Maurice Prendergast, conjuring a more Ã©lite, high society. "The assembled works present a compelling panorama of a new, modern America," shares Pamela Franks, acting director and the Seymour H. Knox Jr., curator of modern and contemporary art, in an exhibit release. "A nation and its artists seeking to embrace the future, to honor the past, and, above all, to interpret the present."
