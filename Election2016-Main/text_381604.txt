Miley Cyrus turned 24 on November 23 and, judging by her Instagram, it was the ideal birthday. The celebration kicked off with an Instagram from her fianc√©, Liam Hemsworth, who gave her a unicorn-adorned present. Cyrus revealed that it was a cool rainbow rock that she seems to love a lot more than the engagement ring he got her. Understandable: it's definitely more her style. Cyrus shared a selection of pics from her day, including herself doing yoga with her dog and Facetiming with her bestie. And, of course, waking up in a bed full of her beloved dogs. There was also a surprise party and the most amazing Funfetti cake created in the image of her dog, Emu. That's so Miley.
