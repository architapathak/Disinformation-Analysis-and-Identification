Donald Trump is TIME's Person of the Year 2016 — TIME (@TIME)December 7, 2016 Donald Trump has been named 2016's Person of the Year by TIME, in what one editor from the magazine called "one of the more straightforward" choices. "When have we ever seen a single individual who has so defied expectations, broken the rules, violated norms, beaten not one, but two political parties on the way to winning an election that he entered with 100–1 odds against him?" TIME editor Nancy Gibbs wrote. "I don't think that we have ever seen one person operating in such an unconventional way have an impact on the events of the year." Trump told Today that it was a "tremendous honor" to be named Person of the Year, although he puckered at TIME's choice to refer to him as the president of the "Divided States of America," complaining to host Matt Lauer that it felt "snarky." Hillary Clinton, Mark Zuckerberg, and Beyoncé were also in the running for the 2016 title, along with the people who blew the whistle on the Flint water crisis. German chancellor Angela Merkel was named Person of the Year in 2015, which feels like a very, very, very long time ago at this point. Watch: Donald Trump's Day One Agenda
