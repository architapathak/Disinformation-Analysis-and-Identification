English musician ANOHNI shared a minimalist video for "Obama" today, featuring two subjects lip-synching the song against a blank backdrop. Previously released Hopelessness videos including "Marrow," "Crisis" and "Hopelessness" were also shot in this style. Along with the video, ANOHNI also shared an impassioned message entreating President Obama to pardon whistleblower Chelsea Manning. "OBAMA, I voted for you. I campaigned for you across Europe.Like thousands of others, in the newspapers and on TV, I told European press that you were a feminist, a kind and reasonable man, a just and fair man, that you would restore our country's dignity. OBAMA, Please let Chelsea Manning out of prison.Recognize her tremendous sacrifice, and her vulnerability.With Trump incoming, if you leave Chelsea in prison,she will never see the light of day, or worse. If you leave Chelsea Manning in prison for whistle blowingYou send the final message to our nationthat the Obama administration brutally punished moral couragein these unforgiving United States. She has suffered Enough, President Obama.She poses no threat. Show us the heart of the Obama administration now. The election is over.There is no political advantage left in allowing Chelsea to perish in prison. Have mercy on her, Obama,friend of the trans community:I implore you to Free Chelsea Manning."
