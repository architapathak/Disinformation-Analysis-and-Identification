"THE biggest risk in Europe is the Italian referendum," said Gianfelice Rocca, of Milan's chamber of commerce(source: The Economist)Italy voted last weekend on the referendum on constitutional reform. Prime Minister Renzi staked his political reputation on the proposals that seek to strengthen what is widely regarded as a (constitutionally) weak and ineffective government. He has said he would resign if the country votes 'NO' (and did), likely triggering an election where the Eurosceptic Five Star Movement would feature strongly and, if they held the balance of power, raise the prospect of a further referendum to leave the European Union. Did Renzi raise the stakes too high? Probably. Regardless whether the proposals were sound, - Italy's record in passing laws is no worse than most - or whether Renzi needed to raise the stakes so high is largely irrelevant to market participants in the shorter term. Siamo dove Siamo. We are where we are. Many have similarly likened an Italian NO to the successful 'nationalistic' Brexit Leave and US Trump votes. But a Machiavellian could argue those votes were for change. YES was the constitutional change even but NO was for real change. The similarity to previous key votes (Greece, Brexit, Trump) in the last 18 months was and is too close to ignore and continues to provide sound templates going forward in this self made Italian fiasco.
