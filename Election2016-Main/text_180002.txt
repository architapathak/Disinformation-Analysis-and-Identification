On this day in 2008, the United States voted into office its first black president. In his eight years in office, Barack Obama has been no paragon of good, but this grating, post-truth election cycle makes it hard not to look back on his term with some fondness. As arguably the most powerful person in the free world, Obama is a natural target for GIF artists to adapt to their styles, either spoofing the powerful or rallying to his positive accomplishments. We sifted through hundreds of C-SPAN GIFcaps, samples from South Park and SNL, and alt-right meme wizardry in order to bring you six Obama-inspired artworks by which to remember a slightly more sane political system. This is also your official The Creators Project reminder to get out and vote on Tuesday, November 8. Of course, the end of Barack Obama's presidency also marks FLOTUS Michelle Obama's final days in the White House (for now), so here's a slam dunk of a GIF for the First Lady.
