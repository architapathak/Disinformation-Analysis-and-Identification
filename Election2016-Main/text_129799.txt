The Dalai Lama, who has a long history of buddying up with sitting US presidents, said Wednesday during a trip to Mongolia that he has "no worries" about Donald Trump winning the presidential election, the Associated Press reports. Despite the president-elect's derogatory comments towards minority groups throughout his campaign, the 81-year-old spiritual leader believes that once Trump is actually in the Oval Office, he'll reign in some of the vitriol. "I feel during the election, the candidate has more freedom to express. Now once they [are] elected, having the responsibility, then they have to carry their cooperation, their work, according [to] reality," The Dalai Lama said, according to AP. "So I have no worries." The exiled Tibetan leader went so far as to say he'd love to meet up with the president-elect after his inauguration on January 20, though it wasn't clear if a meeting was actually being scheduled.
