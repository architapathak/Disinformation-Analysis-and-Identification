In one of his first interviews since leaving office in 2015, former House Speaker John Boehner spoke to VICE founder Shane Smith about the raucous race for president and his view of Bernie Sanders. “I’ve never seen anything like this in my lifetime and neither has anyone else,” Boehner said. And while Boehner didn’t back Donald Trump for president during the primaries, Boehner says he’s backing him now. “I think there’s only one thing that matters in this election, and that’s who appoints the next two, three, four Supreme Court justices,” Boehner says.
