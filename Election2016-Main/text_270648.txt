Artwork via SoundCloud Following last night's US election results, Houston-born, Berlin-based experimental producer Lotic (aka J'kerian Morgan) has released an unofficial edit of Beyonce's "Formation." His "Election Anxiety/America Is Over" rework gives the Mike Will Made It-produced Lemonade track an industrial edge and marching band drums. Morgan also shared an accompanying note on SoundCloud: "being in the time zone i'm currently in meant that i woke up just as the first polls were closing. i watched anxiously, while trying to go about my day as usual, as he consistently held the lead both in the popular and electoral vote. while not surprised, i immediately began to mourn for those whose lives will immediately be affected by the unfortunate outcome of this election. all i knew to do was to try to offer the tiniest bit of hope to them, to all of us. i know it's not much, but working on this helped me keep sane (?!) throughout this tragedy. here is my 'election anxiety/america is over edit' of beyonc√©'s 'formation'. (free download coming once i've had more time to process all of this and to properly mix and master.) all we can do right now as we look hate in the face is respond with love. channel your anger, your sorrrow, all of your confusion. for good. stay safe, but offer a loving hand." In February, New Orleans bounce artist Big Freedia told us how she ended up contributing ad libs to the track.
