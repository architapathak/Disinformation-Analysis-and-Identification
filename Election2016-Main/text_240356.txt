After that awkward, weirdly cordial sit-down with President Obama on Thursday, Donald Trump now says he may go back on his promise to repeal the Affordable Care Act, something he pledged to do throughout his presidential campaign. In his first interview with the Wall Street Journal since the election, Trump said that he will review the portions of the 2010 law that Obama stressed he'd like to keep in place. Obama reportedly asked him to consider the provision about keeping young people on their parents' insurance until they're 26 years old, and prohibiting insurers from denying people coverage based on pre-existing conditions. "I like those very much," Trump told the Journal. "I told him I will look at his suggestions, and out of respect, I will do that." Trump placed repealing Obamacare as a top priority in his plan for his first 100 days in office, which he released in October. Trump called the Care Act a "horror" on the campaign trail and vowed that he would get rid of it and replace it with "something great." Now he seems to be open to compromise. "Either Obamacare will be amended, or repealed and replaced," the president-elect told the Journal. Watch: VICE News Checked in with America After Trump's Win
