At least three people were struck by gunfire in a shooting near voting locations in Azusa, California on Tuesday in what was initially said to be a mass shooting. Law enforcement officials described an active-shooter situation, with at least one heavily armed suspect at-large, the Los Angeles Times reported. That suspect has since been found dead after a lengthy standoff, though the nature of his death was unclear. The paper added that first responders took heavy fire from the shooter, who apparently was armed with a rifle. One victim was found dead at the scene, and two others were taken via air to a local hospital. Not long after the shooting, the LA County election registrar encouraged residents of the area near Fourth Street and Orange Avenue to vote elsewhere. Registrar Dean Logan tweeted that two voting places—Memorial Park and Dalton Elementary—were "impacted," and according to the LA Times, at least one victim was on their way to a poling place. The latest VICE Mass Shooting Tracker numbers—which track incidents where four or more are shot or killed—show more than 350 people have been killed and some 1,300 more injured in US mass shootings so far in 2016.
