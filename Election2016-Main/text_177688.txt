This is my mom, Mimi Rutland. She's an elementary school teacher, a breast cancer survivor and children's book author.  She has the patience of a saint and can make friends just standing in line at Publix (I've seen it).  Our family hadn't been all together since last Christmas, and my mom thought it wouldn't be until this Christmas that me, my sister and my parents would all be together. It's been tough on her since I moved to California with my husband, and my younger sister lives in New York City for grad school.  But little did she know my sister, my husband and I decided to fly to their home in Florida on Saturday for her 60th birthday to throw a surprise party. I think she was surprised. We also threw in some hints of our parents' 30th anniversary that is coming up soon.  We don't get to give back to our mom often, so we were glad we could make this day special. With all the stress and animosity going around from this election, it's important to remember what's really important in our lives. Regardless of who wins, my family will still be the most important part of my life.
