Former Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein is raising money to foot the bill for a vote recount in three key states Hillary Clinton lost to Donald Trump, the Hill reports. Stein's camp released a press release Wednesday afternoon announcing its intention to file for a recount in Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania—all of which went for Trump—and asking supporters for donations to help raise the $2.5 million necessary to fund the recount. "After a divisive and painful presidential race, reported hacks into voter and party databases and individual email accounts were causing many to wonder if our election results are reliable," Stein said in the release. "These concerns need to be investigated before the 2016 presidential election is certified." Stein's effort comes a day after a group of computer science experts reportedly called on Clinton to push for a recount, citing suspicious voter turnout in counties using electronic voting machines, though it should be emphasized that there's no actual proof that the machines were hacked. (Clinton has not demonstrated any willingness to go down this road.) The Stein camp will have to raise the cash before the states's recount request deadline of Friday. As of Wednesday afternoon, Stein had already gathered around $200,000.
