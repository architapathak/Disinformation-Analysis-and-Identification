Republican VP hopeful and Bond villain cosplayer Mike Pence told reporters Wednesday that he disagrees with his running mate's beliefs that President Obama is not a natural-born citizen, NBC reports. "I believe Barack Obama was born in Hawaii," Pence said, contradicting the continuously disproven birther conspiracy that Trump conveniently latched on to in 2011—one that helped fuel his rabid fan base and political career. "I accept his birthplace," he added. Trump has since refused to apologize for all his previous birther talk during the 2012 election and told Bill O'Reilly Tuesday that he didn't think any of it hurt his standing with black voters, anyway. Pence's statement may have contradicted Trump's birther nonsense, but the former Indiana governor was clear that Trump doesn't have any apologizing to do to the black community for the unfounded conspiracy mongering. "Trump's record both as a businessman and as a political leader and a patron in supporting minority efforts—and particularly supporting the African American community—really speaks for itself," he said.
