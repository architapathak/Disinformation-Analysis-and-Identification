Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump's parties will be protected by a small army come election night. Cops with heavy artillery are patrolling the area on the eve of election day -- with scores of muscle handling security at Hilton Midtown for Trump's party and also at the Jacob Javits Center for Clinton's bash. The venues -- which are less than 2 miles apart -- are also getting protection from K-9 and counterterrorism units. More than 24 hours out ... officials are already super strict about who's getting access for party preparations. Last week the FBI named NYC a possible target for an election eve terrorist attack. Easy to see why this is the largest election detail the NYPD's deployed -- it's the first time since 1944 both presidential candidates will be in NYC on election night.
