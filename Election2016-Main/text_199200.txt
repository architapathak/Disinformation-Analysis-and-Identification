Hillary Clinton pulled out the big guns ... from the Prez on down ... for the final night before the election. From Independence Hall in Philadelphia where the Obamas, Bruce Springsteen, Bill, Chelsea and others rallied around their candidate, to a midnight rally in Reynolds Coliseum in Raleigh, where Lady Gaga ï»¿and Bon Jovi showed their support, to Washington Square Park in NYC, where Madonna threw a shindig. Out with a bang.
