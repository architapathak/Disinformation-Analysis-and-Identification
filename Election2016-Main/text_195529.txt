Donald Trump missed out on a fine display of the First Amendment when 2 topless women burst into his polling place with a juicy message scrawled on their bods. The women barged into the midtown Manhattan polling station -- where Trump later voted -- chanting, "Out of our polls, Trump. Out of our polls, Trump." They'd also written "Trump" and "Grab your balls" on their bare torsos. They were almost immediately arrested and reportedly booked for electioneering -- a misdemeanor prohibiting the display of badges and signs supporting a candidate at a polling place. Btw, the toplessness -- totally legal in NY state.
