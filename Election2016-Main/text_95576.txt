Soon-to-be First Lady Melania Trump is the biggest thing to come out of Slovenia since craft beer ... and we've learned the leaders of that country has already tried establishing a relationship with her and her hubby. An official from the Embassy of the Republic of Slovenia tells us President Borut Pahor and Prime Minister Dr. Miro Cerar sent Melania a congratulatory letter after the election. We're told the letter -- written in Slovenian -- expressed their gratitude to Melania for "raising visibility of our central-European country." Melania was born in the southeastern city of Novo Mesto. We're also told President Pahor spoke with Donald and Melania by phone this week and invited them to visit. 2017 marks the 25th anniversary of diplomatic relations between Slovenia and the U.S., and officials want the Trumps front and center for the commemoration.
