Influential electronic musicians all across the genre spectrum—from D∆WN to Kaskade, and Diplo to the Dirtybird crew—are encouraging people to get out and vote in today's presidential election by collectively posting to Twitter and Facebook with #WeDanceWeVote. Their attempt to spur mobilization comes as no surprise, as DJs, producers, and venues have been regularly involved this entire election season. Among the many instances of this happening, some notable examples include Diplo soundtracking a Bernie Sanders campaign ad, ANOHNI telling Americans they were "being used" in regards to the election cycle, and Flying Lotus producing a Sanders-endorsing track by Smoke DZA. Others include Aphex Twin caricaturing the election with an absurdist video yesterday, Steve Aoki playing a Clinton rally, and Axwell serving Marco Rubio a cease and desist letter, among a whole spate of others. If these artists' rallying calls aren't enough, President Obama also wants you to vote, and he's using Spotify to remind you. On top of that, you could probably guess this, but a Donald Trump presidency would definitely be bad for nightlife. — kodak white (@diplo)November 7, 2016 URGENT: — bad boi mija (@hi_mija)November 7, 2016 HER... — D∆WN (@DawnRichard)November 8, 2016 We're joining the dance music community to support — Dirtybird (@dirtybird)November 7, 2016 — Fool's Gold Records (@FoolsGoldRecs)November 7, 2016 Follow Alexander on Twitter.
