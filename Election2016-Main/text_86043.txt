The first presidential debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump was the most-watched debate in history, a showdown between the two candidates at the center of a uniquely contentious campaign. And the vice-presidential debate between Tim Kaine and Mike Pence was... fine. But the second presidential debate, Sunday at 9 PM EST, finally inches us closer to an election cycle that has already gone on far too long. It will also be the best chance for regular people to ask the candidates questions. The format of this debate, moderated by CNN's Anderson Cooper and ABC's Martha Raddatz*, is a town hall, designed to let an audience of undecided voters quiz the candidates on the issues. In theory at least, this will let us see Clinton and Trump interact with actual Americans, who live outside of the media bubble, and maybe allow for more questions that have nothing to do with the banal "narrative" of the campaign. But sometimes these questions can be brutalâ€”at an event focusing on national security hosted by NBC last month, a former Navy officer in the audience asked Clinton, "How can you expect those such as myself who were, and are, entrusted with America's most sensitive information to have any confidence in your leadership as president when you clearly corrupted our national security?" It's hard to say whether Sunday's audience will be as tough as that guy was, but given the often intense dislike the two candidates inspire, there is sure to be some heat thrown their way. And if there are any members of the audience reading this, here are some questions we really hope you'd ask:  Update: An earlier version of this article failed to mention that ABC's Martha Raddatz was co-moderating the debate with Anderson Cooper.
