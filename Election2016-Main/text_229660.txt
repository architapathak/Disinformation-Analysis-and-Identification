Florida's Wintertime, who first caught Noisey's attention earlier this year through his work with Lil Yachty, is back in season (get it???). That's right, after the viral success of his summery "Thru It All" video, he's embracing his snowy moniker with a goofy animated video plunging him into a Gameboy game for "All the Time 2," which Noisey is premiering below. The video came from animator Nirvan, a.k.a. @thedotcomcrash, who sent it to Wintertime "out of the blue." It was an obvious selection, the goofy neo-retro vibes perfectly fitting the humorous, post-Soulja Boy charm of Wintertime's music. Much like his video game alter ego, Wintertime knows the recipe for simple fun. He's also taking that formula on the road early next year with similarly over-the-top rap sensation Ugly God. Given the momentous occasion, we hit Wintertime up with a few questions over email to learn more: Noisey: What is this song about?Wintertime: This song is just another Wintertime scripture put into music form. Sometimes I got to remind everybody I can still rap. I hate rapping just 'cause it's so easy now days. Anyone can do it. I make songs like this in my sleep. You're going on tour with Ugly God. What do you like about his music?He don't give a fuck about anything. I respect it. What's one thing you want people to know about your music?Everyone should know by now that Wintertime is the greatest song writer of this generation. Only artist that can do anything. What is one piece of advice you have for our readers?Stay in school. This shit not for everyone. What did you eat for breakfast this morning?Just some frosty flakes you feel me. Light work.
