Biscuits, a podcast on VICE Sports, takes an analytical, irreverent, and humorous look at the world of hockey and the NHL. Listen as hosts Sean McIndoe (of Down Goes Brown fame) and Dave Lozo react to the week's biggest stories and most absurd news. In this week's episode, Dave and Sean talk Jacob Trouba, debate blindside hits, break down the Blackhawks, and discuss the finer points of enraging various fan bases...instead of talking about the election for an hour.
