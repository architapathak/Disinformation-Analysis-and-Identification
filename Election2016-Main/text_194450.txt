Mariah Carey and James Packer were negotiating one of the most insane prenups we've ever seen ... and it reads like she's a mail order bride with lots of strings attached. Before we tell you what it says, we know the negotiations blew up. We're told Mariah's people got the draft from Packer's exec, Robert Rankin, and rejected it as "tacky and insulting." Among the conditions ... "Except for gifts between them for their engagement, wedding or on birthdays and anniversaries, no item of jewelry and/or personal adornment costing over $250,000 will be deemed a gift unless accompanied by, or promptly followed by, a writing specifically stating 'This is my gift to you.'" It goes on ... James agreed to purchase certain clothing for Mariah but there's a blank space for them to agree upon a maximum amount he has to shell out. It states ... the clothing is not to be used for business or performing and "Mariah shall provide all clothing for her children." And there's this ... "James shall cause a credit card(s) to be issued for use by Mariah and staff ... the amount of expenses ... shall not exceed US $____ per calendar month." The amount was blank. The prenup continues ... "James shall provide the use of one private aircraft, of his selection, for Mariah's personal use, or that of her children and nannies only when James, in his sole discretion, determines it is appropriate to do so." The central reason why negotiations blew up ... the provision that said "James will pay Mariah, and Mariah shall accept, $6 million dollars per year for each full year of marriage, up to a maximum of $30 million ... adjusted pro-rata on a weekly basis [$151,385 per week]." Our Mariah sources say she rejected the dollar amount and claims James agreed to a $50 million lump sum if the marriage failed. So much for love.
