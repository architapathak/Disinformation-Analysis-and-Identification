More Floridians voted early in 2016 than in all of 2000  More Floridians voted early in 2016 than in all of 2000  The final results of early voting in Florida are in, and the numbers indicate that residents of the Sunshine State meant business this election year, with a record-breaking turnout.  More than 6.4 million Floridians cast their vote during the Oct. 24–Nov. 6 early voting period, surpassing the key swing state’s entire voter turnout of 5,963,110 in the highly contested 2000 presidential race between Republican George W. Bush and Democrat Al Gore. Here’s a breakdown of notable early-voting stats: —Roughly half of Florida’s 12.9 million registered voters cast their ballots early, up 80 percent from 2012. —Early votes cast by Latinos were up 108 percent compared to 2008.  —Democrats have the edge by approximately 87,000 ballots. Democrat Floridians cast almost 2.6 million votes, compared to almost 2.5 million for Republicans. But the Tampa Bay Times observed that the Dems’ early-voting lead this time falls short of the 100,000 they had in the 2012 race.
