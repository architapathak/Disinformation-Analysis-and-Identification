Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte made another shocking claim this week when he said that he once threw a "corrupt" person from a helicopter in flight as punishment. He then threatened to do it again. "If you are corrupt, I will fetch you using a helicopter to Manila and I will throw you out," Duterte said in Filipino during a speech about typhoon-relief efforts. "I've done it before; why can't I do it again?"  Duterte's helicopter threat was aimed at officials who misuse relief-effort funds. The person thrown from the helicopter was a kidnapper and murderer, Duterte said. Later, however, Duterte denied that he had thrown someone from a helicopter, implying the comment was a joke.  "We had no helicopter. We don't use that," he told CNN Philippines.  Duterte then went on to poke fun at media coverage of his comments. A spokesman has said Duterte's comments should be taken "seriously but not literally," echoing statements made during the US election, that the press takes Donald Trump literally but his supporters take him "seriously but not literally."
