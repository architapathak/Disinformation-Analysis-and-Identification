Trump's favorability among Americans has been on the rise since he was elected president two weeks ago, according to a new poll from POLITICO/Morning Consult. Before the election, Trump's popularity was hovering around 37 percent, but that number has jumped sharply up 9 points since he bested Hillary Clinton. The poll found that 46 percent of registered voters now have a favorable or somewhat favorable view of the president-elect. "This honeymoon phase in common for new presidents," Morning Consult's co-founder said of the polling numbers. "For example, Obama saw about a 20-point swing in his favor following the 2008 election." The poll found that Barack Obama's numbers were also up, with 54 percent of respondents approving of the job he's doingâ€”even though the country just elected a man who seems likely to overturn a lot of Obama's policies.
