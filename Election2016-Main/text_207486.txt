Today, at the annual meeting of the American Society for Cell Biology (ASCB), the organization will premiere three new videos created by ASCB member labs with the theme of "Tell Your Own Cell Story." This is a yearly thing, in which Celldance Studios, aka the ASCB's public information arm, awards small grants to a selection of labs to create films showcasing their research in artful and creative waves. Fortunately, for those of us not at the ASCB meeting this week, the 2016 results have been made publically available on Vimeo. Enjoy: "Cell Division: Live & Up Close," Daniela Cimini and colleagues at Virginia Tech's Biocomplexity Institute. "The Big Squeeze: What Dendritic Cells Do to Fight Infection," Matthieu Piel and colleagues at the Institut Curie and the Institut Pierre-Gilles des Gennes. "Discovery Inside Living Cells in Multicellular Organisms," National Institutes of Health (NIH) lab of Roberto Weigert in the Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, and the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research.
