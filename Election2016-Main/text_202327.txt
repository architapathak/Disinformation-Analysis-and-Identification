Miley Cyrus got the VIP treatment on election day -- literally driving into a polling place and casting her ballot while Liam Hemsworth never let go of the steering wheel. Miley hit up a fire station in Bev Hills that offers curbside voting service. Check out the vid ... a firefighter leads her into the station's driveway where Miley hands her ballot. Only in Hollywood ... cause even Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump had to walk inside a polling place, walk inside and cast their ballots. Turns out ... there's curbside voting at polling places in L.A. County, but it's only available to a select few. And in case you're wondering ... Miley's with her.
