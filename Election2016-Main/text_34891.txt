As we loom on the precipice of the weird political apocalypse that we've somehow created for ourselves, here are some things to help you cope with the weight and scope of America's presidential election, which, as you may know, is taking place today. Helen Hollyman, Editor in Chief: I will be watching this with the sound off: While this is CRANKING: Matt Zuras, Senior Editor: Red pandas don't know what a Donald Trump is. They don't know anything about the Clinton Foundation-State Department nexus. They don't know how to email or tweet or slander other kinds of pandas. They just eat bamboo and frolic and nap, and that's a pretty decent way to live if you ask me. Hilary Pollack, Associate Editor: I just want bubble tea. The texture of the boba soothes me. (Never forget when Hillary Clinton called it "chewy tea.") ADIDABT. Drinking bubble tea and listening to Stars of the Lid is better than Xanax. Also, check out this pet crab eating an onion ring. He is so sick. Like sick as in tight. Like tight as in good. I am delirious. Farideh Sadeghin, Culinary Director: I will be sucking down Manhattans because they are the only perfect thing that I can turn to today. Sydney Mondry, Social Editor: I ate a whole pint of So Delicious brand almond milk cookies and cream ice cream last night. Not my preferred flavor but the store was out of Van Leeuwen's salted caramel and I was desperate. But then I had night sweats which I'm almost positive was linked to the ice cream and also impending doom. Elana Schulman, Supervising Producer: I ate a chocolate croissant in five seconds.
