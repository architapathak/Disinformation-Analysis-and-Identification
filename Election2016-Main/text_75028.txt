Planned Parenthood has received a huge outpouring of support in the wake of Donald Trump's election. More than 200,000 people made donations to the women's healthcare organization in the past week and a half—more than 46,000 of those were made in Vice President–elect Mike Pence's name. Many pro-choice advocates are worried that Trump and his new VP would effectively try to eviscerate women's reproductive rights, as both have run on anti-abortion agendas. Trump said he would appoint pro-life Supreme Court justices in an effort to overturn Roe v. Wade, and Mike Pence was one of the first representatives in Congress to propose a bill to defund Planned Parenthood, which offers all kinds of services for women, including STD screenings and contraception.  VICE News spoke to Planned Parenthood's executive vice president, Dawn Laguens, and the CEO of Planned Parenthood Indiana and Kentucky, Betty Cockrum, to find out how the organization is gearing up to fight four years of an extremely anti-abortion administration.  "I believe that if we can have an outpouring now of people—as we are—saying, 'Hey, this is not the agenda I signed up for,' that maybe we can actually get them to not go at some of this stuff," Laugens said. "On the other hand, when they go, we're going to be ready." Watch the clip from Thursday's episode above and make sure to watch VICE News Tonight weeknights at 7:30 PM on HBO.
