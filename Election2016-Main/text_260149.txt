A new marketplace app called #NeverTrump is connecting third-party voters in swing states with Clinton supporters in safe Democrat states, so they can broker vote "trades," Vox reports. After users sign up for the app and say where they live and who they plan to vote for, users enter a chatroom where they can pair up and agree to swap their votes. The idea is that a Clinton supporter will agree to vote for Jill Stein, Gary Johnson, or Evan McMullin in their heavily blue state if the third-party voters use their vote for Clinton in a swing state that could possibly go to Trump. That way, third-party voters still get to feel like they're standing behind their preferred candidate, and Clinton gets a boost in a swing state, while both voters work together in an effort to keep Trump out of the White House. Despite what the Republican nominee says about this election being "rigged," this kind of "vote trading" is legal, since no money is changing hands and pairs who agree to trade their votes are only held to the honor system come Election Day. "Vote trading is just people deciding how they're going to vote, based on forming a strategic political alliance," constitutional law professor James Raskin told Vox. "In some sense, it is the principal activity of Democracy." Read: A Trump Supporter Was Arrested for Trying to Fight Election Fraud by Voting Twice
