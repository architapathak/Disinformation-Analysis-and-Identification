After continually blasting Hillary Clinton for being a "Wall Street puppet" during the campaign, Donald Trump has picked yet another Goldman Sachs executive to work in his administration, NBC News reports.  On Friday, Trump reportedly offered Gary Cohn, the president and COO of Goldman Sachs, the job as director of the National Economic Council. Should he accept, Cohn would be tasked with overseeing and advising the president on domestic and international economic policy. Cohn is the third administration appointee with ties to the baking giant. Trump has already given Steve Bannon, a former Goldman Sachs investment banker, the job as his chief strategist, and tapped Steven Mnuchin, a longtime Goldman Sachs partner and Hollywood producer, for treasury secretary.  Trump's transition team hasn't confirmed the pick yet, but that didn't stop Bernie Sanders from jumping to point out the irony in Cohn's selection.
