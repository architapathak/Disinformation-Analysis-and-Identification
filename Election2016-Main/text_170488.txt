Good DJs and radio hosts are innate tastemakers, so it's only natural that they parlay their ear for talent into a record label—just look at contemporary figures such as Pete Tong, Nina Las Vegas, B. Traits, and London radio station Rinse FM. The latest to take the label plunge is Brisbane crew and radio show Beats of No Nation, run by Dom Bird, Jad Lee, and Sean Bate. With a mission statement to showcase "weird and wonderful sounds from all around the globe," they sling crate-dug selections across the 4ZZZ airwaves alongside guest mixes from both international stars including Dego, Lobster Theremin, and Rhode & Brown; and local talent such as Touch Sensitive, Francis Inferno Orchestra, and Mall Grab. To kick off the eponymous label, Beats of No Nation have enlisted Super Fun Bumper Edition—the newly-minted duo of Future Classic mainstay Charles Murdoch and BONN's very own Lee—to produce its debut EP, Trends. Despite only just making their collaboration official, the pair actually have prior history together as members of indie-dance band Mitzi. It's no surprise, then, that the four-track EP sounds playful and organic, like two friends horsing around on their laptops and going wherever the late night takes them. Rolling, house-y A-sides "Merge" and "Skaplee" could be two halves of the same song; while on the flip side, "Rubber" and "Emperor" progress into moody, metal-pinging techno and wonky, brain-tingling R&B, respectively. "We were pretty surprised to have four finished songs after only two studio sessions," the pair told THUMP over email. "But I guess we've played in band together for years so it was basically just felt like jamming ideas with your mate. We didn't know a release would come out of it, but we are glad it did."
