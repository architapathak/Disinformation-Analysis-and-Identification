Jamie Foxx has a ton of mixed emotions about this year's presidential election -- but he's sure of one thing ... we're getting closer to President West in 2020. Jamie was in Bev Hills when he told us the comedian in him is LOVING most of the rhetoric about Trump vs. Clinton. As he put it ... the "level of craziness" is off the charts -- and the way Jamie sees it ... Kanye West should be sitting back and licking his chops at all of it. Check out the clip. It's a not so subtle dig at Trump. But Jamie does admit he's more than a little biased. Aren't we all?
