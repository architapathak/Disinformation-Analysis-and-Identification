I'm fed up of writing what a terrible, dreadful, concerning week it's been. I'm fed up of saying either "so here are some suitably aggressive selections from this week" or "so here are some uplifting balmy breezers to take your mind off things". With that in mind, here are seven tracks and mixes from this week that bear absolutely no correlation to the week's eventsâ€”some are tense, some blissful, some roof-raising, and some so ambient you'll barely have noticed they've started. First, there are the fruits of Kode9's trip to Japan with Boiler Room, then there's a stark new cut from Struction on R&S, followed by a typically intricate number from David August. Addison Groove and Sam Binga's recent stint on Radio 1 has just hit SoundCloud, alongside a fractured NTS show from Ron Morelli and a gooey hour of balearic from Zombies In Miami. Then, finally, enjoy a very special mix from Marcel Vogel, representing Lumberjacks in Hell who are celebrating six years in business. Follow Angus on Twitter.
