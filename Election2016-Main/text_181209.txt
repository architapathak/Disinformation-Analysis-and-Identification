At some point in their lives, these 17 presidents tended bars, crafted toys, and even personally hung criminals. Here are the 17 weirdest jobs of US presidents:

Andrew Jackson was a 13-year-old militia courier during the Revolutionary War






 The turbulent, controversial seventh president of the US was actually the last head of state to serve in the Revolutionary War, in some capacity. Andrew Jackson joined the fighting at the age of thirteen and served as a courier, according to a report from CNN. His position with the local militia was informal, but that didn't stop the British from imprisoning the teenager, along with his brother Robert. Some accounts say that when Jackson refused to clean an officer's boots, the enemy soldier slashed his face with a sword, leaving a permanent scar.

Abraham Lincoln owned a bar






 Did you know that Lincoln was the only licensed bartender to rise to the position of chief executive? According to Amy Cavanaugh's article in the Chicagoist, the future president launched a business in New Salem, Illinois. The joint, known as Berry and Lincoln and co-owned by an old militia friend named William F. Berry, functioned as both a store and a drinking establishment. In 1833, Berry and Lincoln received a liquor license and began selling brandy, wine, and whiskey. Later on, the future president would leave the business to become the postmaster of New Salem. Unfortunately, Berry's alcoholism caused the duo to fall into debt — which Lincoln wouldn't fully pay off until he became a congressman.

James Garfield tended to mules






 James Garfield's tenure as the 20th president of the US was cut short by an assassin's bullet in 1881. His presidency was so brief that most historians exclude him from presidential rankings. However, there was a time when Garfield's career was on the rise. According to the " Erie Canal" by Ralph Andrist, the "Ohio farm boy" got his start working for his cousin who owned a canal boat. Garfield made $8 a month driving the boat's mules.

Grover Cleveland executed people






 Today, Cleveland is perhaps best known for serving as both the 22th and 24th president of the US. Few people know about the somewhat morbid turn his career path took early on in his professional experience. While serving as sheriff of New York's Erie County from 1871 to 1874, Cleveland personally hanged two criminals instead of delegating the gruesome task. According to a 1912 article in the New York Times, Cleveland argued that he had "insisted that he had no moral right to impose upon a subordinate the obnoxious and degrading tasks that attached to his office." However, this incident came back to haunt him. According to the White House Historical Association, Cleveland was lambasted as "the hangman of Buffalo" during the 1884 presidential election.

Warren G. Harding was a newspaperman






 Before ascending to a scandal-marred stint in the White House, Harding enjoyed a sterling reputation as the editor of The Marion Star. Harding bought the struggling paper when he was only 18-years-old and immediately began poaching journalists at the 1884 Republican National Convention. He always had a soft spot for the paper. After he became president, he even planned to stay on as an associate editor, according to the Marion Star. Harding died before that could happen.
