I think this is what political operatives call an advance error (I've watched every episode of The West Wing twice and also incorrectly predicted the election, so I'm an expert). President Barack Obama was in Greece and in trying to find common ground with the locals with his remarks, he tried to talk about Bucks point forward Giannis Antetokounmpo (real talk: I copy pasted that off Google, I'm not making the same mistake Obama did). Which meant Obama tried to pronounce his name. This did not go well. This is how Giannis pronounces his name: And Obama: Again, Giannis: Obama: He should've just talked about our shared love of Greek salads.
