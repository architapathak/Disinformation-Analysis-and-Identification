Justin Timberlake is in the clear ... the official in the Shelby County D.A.'s Office who told us they were looking into a possible criminal violation in connection with JT's selfie at the voting booth now says he screwed up. As we reported, Justin's selfie is a violation of a new law that prohibits Tennessee voters from snapping pics or recording their movements at the polls.  A violation is punishable by 30 days in jail. The official told us ... the matter was "under review," but he now says he made a mistake. He says although the D.A. was aware of the selfie, no law enforcement agent, election commission official or police officer had filed a formal complaint, so the matter wasn't on the table for review. So Justin's in the clear, and we're guessing Hillary got a vote.
