The recount is just one that former Green Party candidate Jill Stein has called for in three key states won by Trump, citing hacking concerns. The recount in Michigan was called off by another US judge after only three days, and the Wisconsin recount has yielded a few more votes for Clinton, though not enough to turn the state blue. Diamond released a 31-page document spelling out his decision to reject Stein's recount bid in Pennsylvania, saying that her hacking suspicions were "irrational." "There is no credible evidence that any 'hack' occurred, and compelling evidence that Pennsylvania's voting system was not in any way compromised," Diamond wrote. According to the AP, the Green Party has not yet decided if it will appeal the judge's ruling, though said it was "disappointed." "One thing is clear," Green Party lawyer Ilann Maazel told the AP. "The Pennsylvania election system is not fair to voters and voters don't know if their votes counted, and that's a very large problem."
