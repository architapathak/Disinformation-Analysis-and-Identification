Donald Trump campaign trail rhetoric is driving one NY voter crazy ... so much so the guy's suing the Donald, his running mate and many more ... for a BILLION bucks! A guy named Louis Tafuto -- a registered Republican in upstate NY -- filed the suit Monday, claiming Trump is intimidating American voters by saying he won't accept the results if he loses the election. In the docs, obtained by TMZ, he says Trump is threatening "the core of the democratic way of life." What Tafuto seems to be saying is he's going to vote Trump -- not because he wants to, but because he's afraid of what Trump will do if he doesn't win. Worst of all, he claims to be suffering severe emotional distress because he's been "denied the choice of an honest and capable Republican candidate" -- and for that he's gonna need $1 billion to soothe his nerves. He's suing Trump, Mike Pence, their campaign, RNC chairman Reince Priebus and the RNC itself for the dough. Line forms to the left, pal.
