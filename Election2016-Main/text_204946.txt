Hillary Clinton's life post-election has gone to the dogs. Hill and Bill were spotted out hiking with their pups near their home in Chappaqua, NY Thursday afternoon ... one of their neighbors snapped this shot while out for a walk with her baby. The neighbor says the Clintons seemed relaxed and they exchanged pleasantries for a few minutes, took the pic, then went their separate ways. As rough as Tuesday night was, Hillary's looking good today.
