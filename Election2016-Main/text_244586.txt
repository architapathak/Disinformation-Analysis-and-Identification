Image via Wikimedia Commons Prince had a damn wild life, with anecdotes that veer into the unbelievable frequently. He also kept a lot to himself, meaning that only his close friends truly knew the man behind the purple. But thanks to a delightful GQ piece full of stories from the people who knew Prince best, we now know that he was more like us mere mortals than previously thought, as he enjoyed sharing and making memes. According to director, dancer, and Prince associate Danielle Curiel, Prince "was always sending [her] memes and funny videos. He liked memes of him when people take his face and write captions on his pictures." Photographer Maya Washington, another friend to Prince, shares a similar story. The Purple One's legendary side-eye has indeed been the subject of many a GIF, but the knowledge of being complicit in your own memedom is always a shocker. Other tidbits from the GQ piece include the fact that Prince was, apparently, perpetually lavender-scented ("you never saw Prince [Ô¨Årst], you smelled him") and that he wanted Barack Obama to cancel Christmas presents and birthdays upon the president's election in 2008.
