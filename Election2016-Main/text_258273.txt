Amsterdam duo Maarten Smeets and Lars Dales, aka Detroit Swindle, shared their recent Ray Ban x Boiler Roomsession today, recorded live in Madrid on October 16. The set finds the pair embracing unpretentious fun right from the get go, leading with lush disco before leaning into the groove a bit more with relentless house and techno selections. Their mixing approach is concise and consistent through the 90 minute duration, combining practiced, graceful transitions with a jacking atmosphere. The event was co-presented with sunglasses company Ray Ban, and also featured sets from NYC legend Honey Dijon, Running Back head honcho Gerd Janson, and Zurich's Deetron all performing strictly vinyl-only sets. Detroit Swindle's previous set with Boiler Room was recorded in 2013, at an event produced in partnership with London deep house label Freerange Records. Yesterday, Boiler Room announced that they would launch a virtual reality club in London early next year, and Mixpak leading lady Jubilee shared a scintillating new session through their platform. Early next month, NAAFI, Discwoman, GHE20G0TH1Kand more will curate Boiler Room's first weekender in Lake Harmony, Pennsylvania.
