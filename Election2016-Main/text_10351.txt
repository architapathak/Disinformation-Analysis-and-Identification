Drinking beer and eating huge amounts of junk food with friends is half the fun of football season. But if you're going to see your team play in person and don't have a tailgate to go to beforehand, you might want to check out a fan bar in the area. Location intelligence company Foursquare put together a guide to the most popular fan bars near every NFL stadium in America, drawing upon its data that shows where users tend to go both before and after football games. The bars were selected based on their proximity to each stadium, and by utilizing Foursquare's understanding of foot-traffic patterns to determine if there was a high overlap of people that visit both the bar and the football stadium. In cases where a clear winner wasn't identifiable, Foursquare editors located bars that had tips that included terms such as "football," "game" and the city's team name. What follows is a guide to where you can feel safe drinking among fellow fans.
