While Donald Trump may have let the public peek into his health records, it doesn't look like he's ready or willing to release his tax return information before the election, according to his son Donald Trump Jr. In an interview with thePittsburgh Tribune-Review, Trump Jr.—who is the Trump Organization's executive vice president—said that his father's 12,000 page tax return would invite too many questions from ordinary people. "[It] would create... financial auditors out of every person in the country asking questions that would detract from [his] main message," Trump Jr. told the Tribune-Review. His comments echo those of his brother, Eric Trump, who told CNBC in August that it'd be "foolish" for his father to release his tax returns. He said, "A bunch of people who know nothing about taxes trying to look through and trying to come up with assumptions on something they know nothing about." While Donald Trump has said that he won't release his tax returns because he's under audit, there's nothing legally stopping him from releasing tax returns to the public. Hillary Clinton, on the other hand, has made decades of her tax returns available online. If Trump refuses to release his tax information before November 8, he'll be the first major party candidate to keep his tax returns private since 1976.
