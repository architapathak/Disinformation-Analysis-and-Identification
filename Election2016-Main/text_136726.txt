Ken Moelis, the CEO of the investment bank Moelis & Company, expects Donald Trump to win the US presidential election in November. "I'm predicting that Donald Trump will win the election," he said. Moelis made the comments at the Bloomberg Most Influential Summit in New York on Wednesday. Moelis said companies and people were "desperate" for a change. "We haven't elected a president since George H.W. Bush based on competency," he said. Moelis is the CEO and founder of Moelis & Co., a Wall Street advisory firm. He was recently named 45 on Bloomberg's list of the most influential people in markets. Trump has had a complex relationship with Wall Street. He has attacked Hillary Clinton, his Democratic opponent, for her links to Wall Street banks, but he has also spoken openly about borrowing hundreds of millions of dollars from Wall Street institutions. Billionaire investor Carl Icahn is a vocal Trump supporter, as is Anthony Scaramucci of SkyBridge Capital. Other Wall Streeters, including Howard Marks, have heavily criticized some of Trump's proposed policies.
