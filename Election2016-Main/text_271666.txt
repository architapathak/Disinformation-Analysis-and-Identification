Big media companies are backing newsletter startup theSkimm. Following an $8 million round led by 21st Century Fox that was announced in June, theSkimm announced today that it has raised an additional $500,000 from The New York Times, Yannick Bolloré (CEO of ad giant Havas Group), strategic advisory firm MediaLink and actress Mariska Hargitay. The company says it now has 4 million subscribers (mostly women between the ages of 22 and 34) for a newsletter that distills the day’s headlines into a few key points, conveyed in a conversational, friendly style. It’s also been expanding beyond newsletters with Skimm Ahead, a calendar of upcoming events that costs $2.99 per month. In addition to announcing the funding, theSkimm is also unveiling its latest product, Skimm Studies, which the company describes as offering “an inside look into what female millennials think.” Basically, they’re reports drawn from surveys of Skimm readers, which the company says will be made available for free. For example, their first Skimm Study looks at the upcoming election, finding that 56 percent of respondents say they’re supporting Hillary Clinton, compared to 24 percent undecided and 8 percent for Trump. This also ties into a joint initiative with Rock the Vote, where theSkimm says it has already helped 60,000 people register to vote.
