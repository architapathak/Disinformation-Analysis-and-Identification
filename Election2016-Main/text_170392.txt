Curt Schilling has a message to all the famous Hillary Clinton supporters who threatened to leave the country if Trump won -- "GET THE HELL OUT!!!" The ex-MLB star is FIRED UP over Donald winning the election -- and is calling out some of the outspoken anti-Trump people ... starting with Matt Damon. "Matt Damon, his entire life was made out of gun violence, yet he wants to repeal the 2nd Amendment ... Stop with that bulls**t! You guys lost, GO AWAY!" There's more ... Schilling calls the Clinton people frauds and idiots. Good times.
