NOBODY breaks it down like Killer Mike when it comes to politics, and school was in session when he ran into our photog at LAX on election day. The Atlanta MC and political acitivst was explaining why he's been imploring African-American voters to "stay home" if Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party don't deliver on their promises. The concept seemed counterproductive to our guy -- and that's when Mike started teaching. Or he tried to, at least. Vigorous debate -- 'Merica was built on it, and this was a great one!
