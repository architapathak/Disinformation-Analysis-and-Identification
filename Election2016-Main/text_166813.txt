Here's the thing: For the past week, we've really needed, appreciated, and certainly indulged in the wonder that is "comfort food." But let's not forget that the holidays are just around the bend, and that the stuff is here to stay for at least the next month and a half or so. Look, no matter what you may think of the outcome of the election, this is America. And one of our country's proudest traditions across party lines is to celebrate the joys of eating glorious, fattening junk, especially in company of loved ones during the winter months. This hash brown casserole from chef Benjamin Sukle of Oberlin and Birch tastes like home, no matter where your home might be. A simple combination of hash browns, cream of chicken soup, shredded cheese, onion, cornflakes, and melted butter, it's decadent as all hell, but its unpretentious deliciousness might just be the one thing you and your crazy uncle can agree on at the Thanksgiving table. That's what junk food's for: bringing people together. And right now, we damn well need it.
