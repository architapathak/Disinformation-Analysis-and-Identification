* Fed statement due at 2 p.m. ET * Gold at near one-month high * Brocade rises after $5.5 bln Broadcom offer * Alibaba up after quarterly revenue beats estimates * Indexes down: Dow 0.22 pct, S&P 0.22 pct, Nasdaq 0.17 pct (Updates to open) By Tanya Agrawal Nov 2 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks opened lower on Wednesday, with the S&P 500 falling for the seventh straight day as a tightening race for the White House prompted investors to seek safe-haven assets such as gold. Investors are rethinking their long-held bets of a Nov. 8 victory for Democrat Hillary Clinton amid signs that her Republican rival Donald Trump could be closing the gap. While Clinton held a 5 percentage point lead over Trump, according to a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll released on Monday, some other polls showed her Republican rival ahead by 1-2 percentage points. “As the polls change, the market is growing more nervous and is beginning to price in a Trump presidency,” said Andre Bakhos, managing director at Janlyn Capital LLC in Bernardsville, New Jersey. “While Clinton represents a status quo, there is little clarity on what kind of impact Trump’s policies will have on trade and foreign policy.” Gold hit a near one-month high earlier in the day, suggesting investor anxiety over the election. Wall Street closed lower on Tuesday, with the S&P 500 ending the day at the lowest level since July 7. The index had breached a key technical level earlier in the session. The selloff in equities comes as the Fed holds its two-day policy meeting, with a statement due at 2 p.m. ET (1800 GMT). While traders do not expect the central bank to raise interest rates just a week before the election, they are looking for clues that the Fed is set to hike rates in December. Traders are pricing in a 73.6 percent chance of a December hike, according to CME Group’s FedWatch tool.
