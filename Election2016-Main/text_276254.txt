The FBI conducted interviews with Muslim Americans in at least eight different states in relation to al Qaeda terror threats purportedly targeting Election Day, according to the Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR). Speaking to the Washington Post, Hassan Shibly, a lawyer and the executive director of Florida's CAIR chapter, said the feds had conducted a "sweep" of individuals in the Muslim community, asking if people knew anyone who might want to harm Americans. The feds allegedly talked to several medical professionals and one youth leader, all of whom were either of Pakistani or Afghan descent. "To conduct a sweep of American Muslim leaders the weekend before the election is completely outrageous and.. . borderline unconstitutional," Shibly told the Post. According to the Shibly, local CAIR branches around the country also received reports about FBI interviews from people in California, Washington, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas. On Friday, the FBI released a statement saying it was still investigating the credibility of the al Qaeda threat, which was thought to target New York, Virginia, and Texas. The bureau said it "shares and assesses intelligence on a daily basis and will continue to work closely with law enforcement and intelligence community partners to identify and disrupt any potential threat to public safety."
