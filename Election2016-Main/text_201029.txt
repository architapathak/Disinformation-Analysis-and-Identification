Wiz Khalifa was in a charitable mood with the paps Friday night ... handing out free weed to his target demo. We got Wiz leaving Catch in WeHo ... with a bag of his own "good s***" you can buy in stores now -- because he can't give all of his KK away. Wiz doesn't seem concerned about the movement to legalize marijuana in the upcoming election, because he's starting his own ... in his souped up '64 Impala.
