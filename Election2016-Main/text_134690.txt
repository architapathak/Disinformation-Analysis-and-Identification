"Shut up, kiss my ass, and move on" is Curt Schilling's message to anyone taking issue with the pic he posted of a man wearing a t-shirt suggesting journalists be lynched. "Rope. Tree. Journalist. Some assembly required" was printed on the shirt ... reportedly worn by a man at a Trump rally. The implication ... a majority of the media has been biased against Donald Trump. Schilling reposted the picture (he didn't take the photo) on Twitter Monday ... and criticism came fast and furiously ... with people saying he was promoting violence against journalist. TMZ Sports talked to Curt ... and asked him why he posted the picture, and what he'd say to people attacking him. He doesn't hold back. We also asked Schilling -- a big-time Trump supporter -- for his thoughts on the election. Here's a hint ... "landslide." Check out the clip!
