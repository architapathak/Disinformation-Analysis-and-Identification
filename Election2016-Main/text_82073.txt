On the evening of the 2012 presidential election, Trump went on a Twitter rant when he mistakenly thought then-GOP nominee Mitt Romney had won the Electoral College while losing the popular vote. Trump later deleted the tweets when it became apparent that Barack Obama had in fact won the popular vote. Now, four years later, it’s looking increasingly likely that Trump will take the White House without the popular vote, a scenario he called “a sham and a travesty” in 2012. As of 10 a.m. Wednesday, Trump had 59,133,398 votes while Hillary Clinton held the lead with 59,297,366 votes.
