U.K’s leading voice for Brexit takes on American politics  U.K’s leading voice for Brexit takes on American politics  This is an extended interview of a segment that originally aired Nov. 7, 2016 on VICE News Tonight on HBO. Nigel Farage is the acting leader of the far-right, populist-driven U.K. Independence Party, and was one of the key figures in the U.K.’s Brexit movement that became a reality in June of this year. Farage sat down with VICE News correspondent Ben Ferguson prior to the U.S. presidential election to discuss the parallels he’s observed between Brexit and Trump’s campaign, which he described as “a political movement.” “They’re voting for an agent for change,” Farage said in reference to Trump voters. “They’re saying we want change, we’re not happy that American politics has virtually become hereditary, that two families have dominated it for the last quarter of a century.”
