Germany’s far-right party is gaining ground  — we spoke to its leaders  Germany’s far-right party is gaining ground  — we spoke to its leaders  In Germany, a far-Right populist party has wrested itself from the political fringes into the mainstream. Following a recent series of regional elections, the Alternative für Deutschland (Alternative for Germany, or AfD) is now represented in 10 out 16 state parliaments and is polling around 15 percent nationally.
