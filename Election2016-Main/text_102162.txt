Ty Dolla Sign has a bleak view of the Presidential election ... 2 bad choices. We got the rapper Friday at Crustacean in Bev Hills ... and he said although both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are flawed, he still has made his choice. BTW ... he says although rappers and Trump have all trash-talked the same, there's a big difference.
