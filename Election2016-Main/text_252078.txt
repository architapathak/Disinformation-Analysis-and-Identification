Hopefully this week has sucked for you, and if it hasn't then you've got some explaining to do. But I'm gonna take a giant L on discussing politics and present this week's Instagram pics from artists. Unless of course they bring up politicsâ€”then I can start ranting again. A work of art next to a naked man in a frame. Does anyone else feel like French is getting way too comfy in that scary wig or is it just me? DC3 doing the #MannequinChallenge in couture? To the tune of Lauryn Hill no less? Sign me up. Um, can we all discuss this? This too. No comment on Cam's caption, but I'm gonna miss HRC's pantsuit. #StillWithHer *single tear* John and Chrissy's baby (since apparently they're my friends) is so cute. I needed to see this after this week. #RIPBigPun Bruno Mars in that mustache looks just like the men on OKCupid who try to holler at me. Ugh. My face after seeing the election results. Badu gives zero fucks in this picture, yet she still looks fierce. Look at Young Thug STYLIN'. G'head!!! Same, Kylie. Same. Yachty is looking fresh in this photo, Mickey Mouse and all. I don't care if you disagree. I love Brandy and this photo, but is it really a part of the #MannequinChallenge without a video and Rae Sremmurd? Kathy Iandoli also participated in the #MannequinChallenge. Follow her on Twitter/Instagram @kath30000.
