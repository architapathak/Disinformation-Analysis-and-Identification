Sacramento Kings center DeMarcus Cousins is not known for having a strong internal filter. He just kind of says whatever pops into the ol' skull, regardless of how impolitic or off-message it might be. That presented something of a problem on Monday when reporters asked him about his new teammate, point guard Ty Lawson. "He's been great. Motherfucker's quick as shit," Cousins said, before instantly realizing that two of those words may not have been appropriate. His reaction to his own statement is priceless. At least this time Boogie's outburst came in praise of a teammate. In June, he came under fire on draft night for tweeting, "Lord give me the strength," after the Kings made the controversial selection of Greek center Georgios Papagiannis. Cousins later claimed that he sent the tweet while struggling through a hot sculpting class. God only knows how much profanity Cousins lets fly during hot sculpting. As for Lawson, who struggled mightily last season between Houston and Indiana, he could probably use the kind words from Sacramento's best player. Kings fans can at least hope motherfucker is indeed still quick as shit, and enjoy their good fortune in having Boogie in uniform.
