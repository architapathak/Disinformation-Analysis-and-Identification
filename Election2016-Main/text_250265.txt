As most of you should hopefully know (if not, um) election day is tomorrow, and it's time to vote for who will be the next President of the United States. In a last minute call to drive young Americans to the polls tomorrow, known Spotify-lover President Barack Obama has teamed up with the service to utilize what's perhaps the one greatest things millennial will respond to: music. Today, 18+ users of some of some of the streaming platform's most popular playlists—Today's Top Hits, Rap Caviar, Hot Country and ElectroNow—will be treated to a custom message from the current—but not for much longer—Commander-In-Chief, driving them to visit Headcount, where they can gain access to information on the election and where they can register. So, whether you enjoy many of these music playlists or not, don't be a passive bystander to one of the most important elections in our lifetimes. Listen to Barry, get out there tomorrow, and let your voice be heard. You can still wear headphones, if you want.
