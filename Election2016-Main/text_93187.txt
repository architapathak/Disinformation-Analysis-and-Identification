FBI Director James Comey said Sunday that a new batch emails the bureau examined regarding Hillary Clinton’s handling of classified information during her time as Secretary of State didn’t turn up any new information. As a result, Comey said in a statement, the bureau has not changed the conclusion that it made back in July: that Clinton should not be charged. Comey announced the findings in a letter to congress on Sunday, just two days before the election. On October 28, when Comey announced plans to review a new batch of emails, politicians on both sides of the aisle accused him of meddling in the political process. During an investigation into the conduct of New York City Congressman Anthony Weiner, emails belonging to Huma Abedin, a top Clinton aide, were found on Weiner’s computer. Correction: Due to an editing error, a previous version of this article misstated the location of the new batch of emails examined by the FBI. The piece also misstated that the FBI was looking into Clinton’s use of a private email server; it had examined her handling of classified information.
