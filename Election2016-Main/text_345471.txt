Denver Broncos linebacker Brandon Marshall received some extremely, extremely racist hate mail and posted a picture of the chicken-scratch letter to his Instagram account on Friday. Slurs outnumber other words by at least a 2:1 ratio, which is bad enough, but the letter is unhinged and threatening, too. It begins "How are you? You are a great football player Mr. Marshall, no you are not!!" And then it devolves into a Mad-Lib of epithets before warning that "your time is coming, watch out nigger." Marshall wrote in the caption, "The hatred by some against people of color is one of the reasons we are where we're at in the world today, and they wonder why we feel the way we do and take the stances that we take. I received this letter at work." The letter appears to be a response to Marshall's early-season protests of taking a knee during the national anthem, not to mention the recent presidential election whose winner rode a wave of overt racism and xenophobia to the White House, further encouraging and enabling these scared-shitless racists. Just this Tuesday, another NFL player had slurs and hate messages scrawled across the walls of his home by burglars. According to ESPN, Broncos security staff is looking into the letter. Denver head coach Gary Kubiak was asked about the letter after practice today and said, "Our organization is on top of it.... That's all I can tell you."
