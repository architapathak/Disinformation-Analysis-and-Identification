The Bald Eagle, America's national symbol, has has a tough week. Meanwhile, the 2016 presidential election is itself off the rails and the third presidential debate will be airing tonight. Coincidence? We think not. Two Bald Eagles had run ins with cars this week, a Jeep and a Saturn. At 7:30 this morning, a Bald Eagle hit the windshield of a Jeep on Florida's Turnpike. Though he had no broken bones, his muscles were sore and his lead levels were higher than they should be, according to the LA Times. Also in Florida, another Bald Eagle got stuck in the grille of a moving Saturn. The Sheriff's Office and Fire Rescue safely extricated the bird from the grille and turned it over to the B.E.A.K.S. (Bird Emergency Aid & Kare Sanctuary) Wildlife Sanctuary. To check in on how other members of America's favorite bird species is doing, you can tune out the debate and tune into a live stream of the Bald Eagle camera from the Audubon Florida Birds of Prey Center on the Audubon's Facebook page. Needless to say, we could all use a break tonight. The poor Bald Eagle seems to be having a disoriented week, and sadly, the symbolism is all too perfect. But it's still a relief to dip out of the Clinton Trump circus and watch how the Bald Eagle is managing amidst the election chaos during the Florida Audubon live stream.
