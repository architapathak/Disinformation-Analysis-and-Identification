As Donald Trump continues to harp on the idea that the electoral system is "rigged" and spreading the widely debunked theory that voter fraud is rampant in America, one of his supporters attempted to vote multiple times to even things out. Terri Lynn Rote was arrested last Thursday for voting for Trump twice in her home state of Iowa, the Des Moines Register reports. The 55-year-old registered Republican voted for the nominee with an early ballot at the Polk County Election Office, then showed up to a different polling site to cast her vote again.  "I wasn't planning on doing it twice, it was spur of the moment," Rote told Iowa Public Radio after posting her $5,000 bail. "The polls are rigged." Rote claimed she feared that her vote would somehow be turned into a vote for Hillary Clinton. Trump spread similar "rigged election" talk over the weekend in Greeley, Colorado, questioning the state's mail-in ballot system and encouraging voters to get a new ballot at an election site in person. His comments caused some to worry that Trump was asking people to vote twice in the state.  As for Rote, she was one of three people suspected of engaging in voter fraud last week in Polk County, according to the Register. Voting twice in the traditional swing state is considered a class D felony of first-degree election misconduct. Rote will head to trial November 7, the day before Election Day.
