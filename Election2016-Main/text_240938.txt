It's been just one week since America elected Donald Trump to be the next president, and the country has already seen reports of over 300 hate crimes, many connected to Trump's own supporters. The future Leader of the Free World was asked during his 60 Minutes interview last Sunday how he felt about the surge in hate crimes following his election, and he had two words to say: "Stop it." He even turned to face the camera and repeated the line, just to drive it home. Last night on Desus & Mero, the hosts talked about how ridiculous and limp Trump's response was, since telling people to "stop" doesn't quite undo an entire campaign built on racism and xenophobia. He's basically using the same tactic you'd use on your dog to keep him from peeing on the rug.
