(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, November 29 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings' fundamental sector outlook for U.S. Life Insurers is negative based on heightened macroeconomic challenges and uncertainty, which are expected to have a negative impact on the industry's underlying credit fundamentals over the near- to intermediate-term, according to a new outlook report by Fitch. The rating outlook for the U.S. life insurance sector is stable for 2017, based on our expectation that key credit metrics will remain in line with rating expectations over the next one to two years. The stable rating outlook reflects the industry's strong balance sheet fundamentals, very strong liquidity, disciplined asset-liability matching, and operating performance that remain generally in line with rating expectations. Over the past year, expected deterioration in corporate credit exposure has been manageable in the context of the industry's capital and earnings. "Key macroeconomic challenges expected to impact U.S. life insurers in 2017 include sustained low interest rates, financial market volatility, and weakening conditions in the credit markets," said Douglas Meyer, Managing Director, Fitch Ratings. While Fitch expects a modest increase in interest rates in 2017 under our base case scenario, we expect further decline in the industry's interest margins and reserve adequacy due to low reinvestment rates and limited crediting rate flexibility on legacy in-force business. Credit-related investment losses are expected to increase somewhat in 2017 under our base case scenario but remain somewhat below historical averages and pricing levels. Key credit concerns that could lead to higher than expected losses include continued weak commodity prices, lower-than-expected economic growth, the impact of expected Fed rate hikes, and increasing geopolitical risk. Sustained low interest rates would likely cause Fitch to revise its rating outlook to negative. This could occur within two to three years based on a 1.5-2.0 percentage point deterioration in the industry's GAAP ROE. Over the past year, the industry's average ROE has been in the 11%-12% range. Conversely, a rise in interest rates by 100-150 basis points could ease the pressure on our rating outlook. "Bond market repricing post-election reflecting the possibility of higher inflation and stronger economic growth in 2017 has been positive for U.S. life insurers. Nonetheless, low rate pressures that have impacted life insurers in 2016 are expected to persist into 2017," added Meyer. The full report is available by clicking on the link. Contact: Douglas L.

In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed.
