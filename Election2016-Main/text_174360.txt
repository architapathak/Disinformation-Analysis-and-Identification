Donald Trump just finished his "Thank You" tour in a very colorful way, with a greeting from some Alabama teens dressed in their Sunday's best. Trump touched down in Mobile Saturday ... and waiting for him were some Alabamians who serve as Azalea Trail Maids, a group of high schoolers chosen to serve as ambassadors for the city. The Prez-Elect then made his way to Ladd-Peebles Stadium where he addressed a large crowd, thanking them for their support during the election. It's no wonder Donald chose Alabama as the grand finale of his tour ... the state supported him with almost 63% of its vote. That's a wrap, y'all.
