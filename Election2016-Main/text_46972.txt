A giant foam blob is enveloping the city of Santa Clara, California. At press time, there were reports that the foam was not in any way connected to President-elect Donald Trump, and was in fact the result of some kind of accident with flame-retardant chemicals.  The heaving white mass materialized on Friday afternoon in an industrial section of Santa Clara, 45 miles from San Francisco. According to the local FOX TV news affiliate, the coating of wobbling, snow-white matter had created a mass as deep as five feet in some spots, completely obscuring parked cars, and preventing bystanders from entering buildings.  At around 1:00 PM local time, a livestream of the expanding, seemingly out-of-control chemical excretion revealed that young men had been riding their bikes through the area relatively unimpeded by the blob. The suds-covered cyclists (who may or may not be members of the alt-right, but whose political stance doesn't particularly matter in a story about a blob) told reporters that police in the area had given them permission to ride through.  This article will be updated as the story—and its complete lack of significance to the selection of Donald Trump's controversial White House transition team—develops.  Follow Mike Pearl on Twitter.
