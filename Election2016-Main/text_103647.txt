The Grammy nominations were announced earlier this month with Beyoncè's nine leading the pack. Yesterday, The Recording Academy announced that the group of recipients of its Lifetime Achievement Awards will include Nina Simone, Sly Stone, The Velvet Underground, Shirley Ceaser, Ahmad Jamal, and more. Many of this year's recipients were artists whose work was politically-charged—a different direction than what many have criticized The Grammys as being limited selection. In a recent New York Times interview, Frank Ocean spoke about withholding his music from Grammy consideration as a protest. He said the awards were not "representing very well for people who come from where I come from, and hold down what I hold down."  The 59th Grammy Awards will take place on Sunday, February 12.
