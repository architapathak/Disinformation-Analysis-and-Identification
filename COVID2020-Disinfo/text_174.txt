An MCNBC analyst has suggested that President Donald Trump could have “criminal exposure” to “homicide” over his response to the COVID-19 crisis.

Former prosecutor Glenn Kirschner, a legal analyst for MSNBC, declared Tuesday that President Trump’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic could make him liable for criminal charges.

Kirschner told his Twitter followers, “Can we talk about 1 of the few topics I may actually know too much about: homicide? Specifically, whether Donald Trump may have criminal exposure for some level of negligent homicide or voluntary/involuntary manslaughter for the way he’s mishandled the Coronavirus crisis.”

Kirschner has a history of slamming the president, including in December when he said “Vladimir Putin owns Donald Trump,” according to the Washington Examiner.
