Hollywood celebrities who performed at the “One World” benefit concert on behalf of the World Health Organization (W.H.O.) have been accused of spreading Chinese propaganda to millions of Americans.

The “One World” concert, led by the W.H.O., was broadcast across multiple television channels in the U.S. on Saturday, with the aim of raising money for the W.H.O.’s COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund.

Taylor Swift, Paul McCartney, The Rolling Stones, Beyonce, Oprah Winfrey, Jennifer Lopez, Elton John, and Lady Gaga all performed at the event, with Lady Gaga gushing that W.H.O. Director-General Tedros Adhanom is a “superstar.”

Breitbart.com reports: The concert also attracted contributions from political figures such as former first ladies Michelle Obama and Laura Bush, as well as celebrity supporters of the cause including former soccer star David Beckham and Microsoft founder Bill Gates.

However, many people were left unimpressed by the event, denouncing the organization’s handling of the Chinese coronavirus pandemic and describing it as a form of globalist propaganda.

“If I could give No stars I would,” one Amazon reviewer wrote. “WHO lied! People died!! Let’s not forgot this!!! While we’re home given up our freedom and most of us without jobs these CELEBRITIES ask us to help raise money for the WHO?! Forget it!”

“Yes, we need useless celebrities preaching to us how this isn’t China’s fault and how we should just all live as one nation,” added another.

Skeptics also lashed out on Twitter against W.H.O. chief Dr. Tedros Adhanom, a former official in Ethiopia’s Marxist Tigray People’s Liberation Front, who has been the subject of widespread criticism for his attempts to downplay China’s role in the outbreak.

That one world together at home commie propaganda sponsored by the CCP WHO and this global citizen bull crap is on at least 20 different stations. You can take your commie propaganda and shove it. THIS IS AMERICA! We are not global citizens we are AMERICAN CITIZENS!!

This would be a wonderful message if Tedros had performed in the initial stages of the fight. He should apologise to the world, otherwise, atulekemu! — odere benji (@BenjiOdere) April 19, 2020

The concert also took place after President Donald Trump pledged to withdraw funding from the W.H.O., citing its connections to China and fatal decision to oppose travel restrictions during the virus’s onset.

“Today I’m instructing my administration to halt funding of the World Health Organization while a review is conducted to assess the World Health Organization’s role in severely mismanaging and covering up the spread of the coronavirus,” Trump said at a White House press conference Tuesday.

“The WHO’s attack on travel restrictions put political correctness above life-saving measures,” he continued. “The reality is that the WHO failed to adequately obtain, vet and share information in a timely and transparent fashion. Fortunately, I was not convinced and suspended travel from China saving untold numbers of lives.”
