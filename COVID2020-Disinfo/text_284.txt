Sirius XM host Howard Stern has slammed President Trump and his supporters, saying they should take disinfectant and “drop dead.”

In an expletive-ridden rant, Stern said he hoped President Trump resigns over his comments about injecting disinfectants.

“Boy, oh boy, I got to tell my buddy Donald Trump, Jesus Christ resign from the presidency. Do the world a favor. You don’t want to be president. Go work at Mar-a-Lago. Have a nice rest of your life. This guy is out of his f-cking mind. I don’t know what Donald is doing. I mean, when he holds a press conference, it’s like you go oh f-ck.”

“I don’t know what to say what’s going on with Donald. I mean, these statements are idiotic. Hey, I have this idea. Maybe since Clorox works on surfaces, couldn’t they just pour Clorox into your asshole,” he continued.

“I would love it if Donald would get on TV and take an injection of Clorox and let’s see if his theory works. Let him, volunteer. Or hold a big rally, say f-ck this coronavirus, with all of his followers, and let them hug each other and kiss each other and have a big, big rally.”

Co-host Robin Quivers added, “A big cocktail of disinfectant.”

“Yeah, and all take disinfectant and all drop dead,” Stern responded.

“It’s an embarrassment. And then the bigger embarrassment is the insult to my intelligence were he goes ‘I was being sarcastic.’ There was no sarcasm. And if he was being sarcastic, that is even worse people are dying. This us no time for sarcasm.”
