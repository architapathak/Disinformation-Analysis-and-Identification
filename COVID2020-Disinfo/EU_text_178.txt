Finally, EU bureaucrats and affilated propaganda bodies are doing something that all has expected a long time ago – blaming Russia for the crisis over the outbreak of coronavirus.

Financial Times learned from a confidential EU report that the Kremlin is allegedly conducting a ‘difinformation campaign’ spreading fake news about how the bloc is fighting the coronavirus outbreak. The article citing the report claims that the goal of the evil Russians is to spread panic and fear among EU citizens and undermine the EU unity and solidarity (like it has ever existed). As always, the report names ‘Russian trolls’ in social media (Facebook, Twitter and Reddit) and state media outlets as main participants in the campaign. The media outlet provides no facts or evidence confirming these claims. However, in the modern world of the post-truth this is not really needed.

No surprise, no mainstream media outlet is reporting a massive ‘coronavirus’ fake news campaign, which targeted Russia itself. Apparently, this does not fit the narrative. This campaign comes jointly with an increase of activity of various Western-funded anti-government organizations inside Russia.

At the same time, Western-funded ‘non-governmental organizations’ appealed the Council of Europe saying that protect prisnoers from ‘coronavirus’ by releasing them. The appeal especially emphasizes the supposedly ‘dare’ situation with this threat in post-Soviet states, meaning Russia. So, under the pretext of fighting coronavirus, they want to push Moscow to release criminals in order to increase social tensions and the criminal activity in large Russian cities.
