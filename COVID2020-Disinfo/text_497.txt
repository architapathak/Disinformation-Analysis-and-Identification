Democratic Rep. Jackie Speier has slammed President Trump for putting “his most ardent supporters at risk” by not cancelling his upcoming political rallies in light of the coronavirus outbreak.

Appearing on MSNBC Sunday, Speier said, “I don’t think the president is capable of telling us the truth about the coronavirus. And I regret saying that. I think we have to rely on the scientists who are attempting to tell the truth even when they have to contradict the president. ”

“The fact that he is not willing to cancel his various rallies suggests that he is willing to place even his most ardent supporters at risk because we’re supposed to stay six feet away from other persons in order to mitigate the exchange of those viruses. I think that he is showing, unfortunately, why he is so ill-prepared to guide our country during this time of the crisis,” she added.

Speaking to reporters on Saturday at Mar-a-Lago, Trump said he had no plans to cancel his MAGA rallies despite concerns about the coronavirus.
