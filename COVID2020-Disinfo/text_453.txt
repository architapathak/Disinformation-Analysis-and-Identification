Former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich has blasted Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer for trying to blackmail Trump into accepting far-left policies and shutting down the bipartisan coronavirus relief bill in the Senate.

Senate Democrats made a sudden U-turn on Sunday night, and blocked the critical $2 trillion COVID-19 economic relief package in a 47-47 vote, despite previously supporting the measures.

The move sent the markets into free-fall, plummeting by over 5 percent on Monday.

President Trump had hoped the package would help stabilize the stock market and U.S. economy.

Speaking to “Fox & Friends” Monday, Newt warned that Pelosi and Schumer, “believe they can blackmail the president into accepting really dumb ideas.”

“What you have now is a power struggle where Pelosi and Schumer believe they can blackmail the president into accepting really dumb ideas,” Mr. Gingrich said.

“I personally do not want to see a Trump-McConnell-McCarthy team that are blackmailed by Pelosi and Schumer and give in,” he added.
