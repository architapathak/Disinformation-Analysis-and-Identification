A courier carrying coronavirus “samples” driving a Honda Civic without bio-hazard signs crashed on the Interstate I-195 in Seebonk, Mass, near the Rhode Island border on Tuesday morning, according to CBSN Boston.

Massachusetts State Police sent a hazardous materials team to examine the coronavirus “samples” and the team determined that they “were not compromised” and the container holding them was intact.

ZeroHedge report: The driver, a 49-year-old woman from Rhode Island, was taken to the hospital as a precaution for potential exposure to the virus.

Another courier was called and ended up delivering the samples to their destination.

Then again, imagine if the woman was driving a Tesla…
