Massive protests have erupted in China over the lockdown conditions imposed by the Communist regime in the Hubei province ‚Äì ground zero for the coronavirus outbreak.

Hubei‚Äôs capital Wuhan is the original epicenter for the pandemic.

Thousands of angry residents have taken to the streets after weeks of lockdown.

The lockdown is, in theory, being lifted, as the Chinese government claims infections in Hubei have dropped to zero.

In videos posted to social media, residents can be seen streaming across the bridge, flipping over police cars and swarming past riot control barriers:

There are MASSIVE protests developing right now on the Jiujiang Yangtze River Bridge that joins the Hubei and Jiangxi provinces in Eastern China.



The situation is rapidly evolving.

Breitbart.com reports: According to the ‚ÄúThings China Doesn‚Äôt Want You to Know‚Äù Twitter account quoted above, there are rumors the riot was kicked off by a fight between Hubei and Jiangxi police officers. The Hubei police were reportedly angered by Jiangxi police crossing into their jurisdiction.

A number of Hubei police officers appear to have joined the civilian demonstrators in their march toward Jiangxi, and evidently raised few objections when the civilians decided to trash a few Jiangxi police cars and club riot police with their own shields.

Noted Chinese dissident Badiucao heard rumors that the fight broke out because Jiangxi police resisted orders to open the border to Hubei after the coronavirus lockdown officially ended on Wednesday. One reason for their reluctance, according to Badiucao, is that ‚Äúno one trusts the official numbers‚Äù for reduced coronavirus infections in Hubei, not even the police.

the conflict starts due to police from different provinces fighting for jurisdiction on checking #COVID19

It escalates into mess riot which blocked whole bridge.

Radio Free Asia (RFA) reported the demonstration was still going strong after eight hours of escalating confrontations:

Jiangxi police on a checkpoint on the bridge had allowed a group of migrant workers stranded during the lockdown to pass, but had refused to allow Hubei residents through. After angry disputes broke out, Jiangxi police sent in riot police to seal off the entrance to Jiujiang. Video footage posted to YouTube showed thousands of people marching up the approach road to the bridge, shoulder to shoulder with uniformed police from Hubei, shouting ‚ÄúGo Hubei! Go Hubei!‚Äù

A Hubei resident told RFA people from the province feel stigmatized and discriminated against, as they are still unwelcome in some other parts of China and treated poorly even when allowed to enter.

RFA confirmed on Friday morning that the bridge battle broke out after Jiangxi police ‚Äúinjured Hubei police in the morning.‚Äù The civilian protesters expressed anger at the way they have been treated during the coronavirus epidemic.

Canada‚Äôs Globe and Mail quoted a Chinese Communist Party (CCP) official yelling at the crowd through a loudspeaker and telling them it was ‚Äúdangerous‚Äù to gather on the bridge due to ‚Äúthe risk of virus infection,‚Äù but the warning did not appear to be widely heeded.

The Communist Party‚Äôs People‚Äôs Daily did report on the bridge conflict even as social media videos were scrubbed, describing it as ‚Äúregrettable.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe people of Hubei have made great efforts and significant contributions to winning the battle against the epidemic. People from all sectors of society have also been calling for the acceptance of Hubei‚Äôs migrant workers. However, it‚Äôs undeniable that some individuals of some regions have intentionally or unintentionally discriminated against Hubei people, set up obstacles for them to return to work,‚Äù the People‚Äôs Daily wrote.

The Globe and Mail reported growing skepticism of the CCP‚Äôs claims to have controlled the epidemic, citing health officials who admitted thousands of asymptomatic patients were systematically excluded from the official counts to produce the ‚Äúzero local infections‚Äù figure uncritically repeated by the World Health Organization and many American media outlets. Furthermore, the number of cremated remains returned to grieving families by the authorities this week is noticeably larger than the 3,200 deaths officially admitted by the CCP.
