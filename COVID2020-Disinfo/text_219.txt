Anti-Trump Hollywood actress Debra Messing has blamed the president for the coronavirus by repeating false claims that he enacted extreme budgetary cuts on the CDC.

Messing launched an unhinged rant on Friday, claiming that President Trump “puts Americans in mortal danger,” citing a two-year-old Washington Post article about proposed budget cuts to the CDC.

The far-left actress failed to mention that those cuts never went into effect and that Congress has actually increased funding of the CDC and National Institutes of Health.

“THIS is why Trump MUST GO! He puts Americans in mortal danger,” Messing tweeted on Friday.

Breitbart.com reports: Messing’s false claim echoes those made by Democratic presidential candidates Joe Biden and Mike Bloomberg during the South Carolina debate on Tuesday. Both candidates accused the president of cutting funding to the CDC, implying that he made the U.S. more vulnerable to a potential coronavirus outbreak.

Bloomberg has also repeated some of those allegations in recent campaign ads.

The Associated Press labelled the claims by Biden and Bloomberg as false in a fact check, noting that both candidates created a “distorted picture” that Congress has boosted funding for the CDC.
