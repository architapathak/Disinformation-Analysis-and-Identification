The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared that abortion is an “essential service” during the current coronavirus panemic.

“Services related to reproductive health are considered to be part of essential services during the COVID-19 outbreak,” WHO said in a statement on Saturday.

“Women’s choices and rights to sexual and reproductive health care should be respected, irrespective of whether or not she has a suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection,” the statement continued.

“Sexual and reproductive health care is integral to universal health coverage and achieving the right to health,” it added.

“This includes contraception, quality health care during and after pregnancy and childbirth, and safe abortion to the full extent of the law,” they said, noting that the WHO provides both global technology and policy guidance to WHO members “on the use of contraception to prevent unintended pregnancy, safe abortion, and treatment of complications from unsafe abortion.”
