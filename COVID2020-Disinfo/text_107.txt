California Gov. Gavin Newsom is responding to the coronavirus pandemic by commuting the sentences of 14 convicted killers.

Newsom made the decision to more quickly commute felons’ sentences in the midst of the coronavirus outbreak, providing early release through parole to around 19 criminals – some of whom killed children and one who murdered a pregnant woman.

The 19 killers given commutations by Newsom include:

50-year-old Rodney McNeal convicted of stabbing his pregnant wife to death

75-year-old Suzanne Johnson convicted of assaulting a child to death

35-year-old Kristopher Blehm convicted for aiding in a murder

Breitbart.com reports: Newsom also pardoned five felons who previously served their sentences for various crimes.

In New York, as Breitbart News reported, Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s (D) insistence that at least 1,100 inmates be released from prison during the coronavirus crisis has allowed eight sex offenders — three of whom raped children — to be freed back into the general public.
