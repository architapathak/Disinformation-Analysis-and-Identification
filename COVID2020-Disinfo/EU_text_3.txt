For a week now, Italy has continued to reduce the burden on local health facilities.

This statement was made by the Director of the Department of Civil Defense of Italy, Angelo Borrelli.

Over the past day alone, about 2 thousand patients infected with coronavirus recovered on the Apennine Peninsula. Thus, the total number of people recovered amounted to almost 30.5 thousand.

The number of deaths over the past day was 579 cases. In addition, more than 98 thousand people continue to fight the disease. 18.8 thousand of them undergo treatment in a hospital. At the same time, 3.5 thousand Italians are in serious condition.

“According to reports, the burden on medical facilities continues to decline. This has been happening for a week”, – commented Angelo Borrelli.

As News Front previously reported, at the height of the epidemic, when Italy was abandoned by its “partners” in the European Union, Russia volunteered to help the republic. As soon as possible, military doctors, medical and nursing teams, as well as equipment for diagnosis and disinfection, were transferred to the Apennine Peninsula. Despite Western attempts to discredit Russian aid, it was it that allowed Italy to overcome the peak in the spread of coronavirus infection COVID-19.
