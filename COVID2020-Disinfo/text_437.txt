Pop icon Cher believes that she and her elderly mother are about to be “sacrificed” by President Trump as he seeks to restart the U.S. economy amid the coronavirus outbreak.

The anti-Trump singer expressed her fear at the president’s desire to see Americans return to work and the economy thrive as soon as possible.

Cher warned on Thursday that she and her mother are “fodder” for President Trump’s “inhumane grist mill.”

Breitbart.com reports: Cher’s message follows a highly publicized rant from MSNBC host Joe Scarborough in which he claimed that conservatives are “ready to euthanize” the elderly in order to save corporate profits in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.

“It is the weakest among us, it is senior citizens who they’re ready to euthanize because they want Boeing’s corporate earnings to not dip too low,” Scarborough said on Thursday’s edition of Morning Joe.

President Trump has spoken recently about his desire to see the American economy re-start and for Americans to return to work as quickly as possible. The president tweeted Sunday that “we cannot let the cure be worse than the problem itself.”

On Wednesday, the president was asked during a White House coronavirus press conference how many deaths would be acceptable to him.

“How many? None. OK? How many deaths are acceptable to me? None, OK? None, if that’s your question,” the president replied.
