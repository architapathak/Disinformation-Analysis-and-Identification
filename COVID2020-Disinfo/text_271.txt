Hillary Clinton took to Twitter on Saturday to show off her new face mask with a political message attached.

Amid the coronavirus pandemic Clinton, who endorsed Joe Biden for president last week, urged Americans to head to the polls this November while makeup free and wearing a face mask with the word ‘Vote’ written on it.

“No makeup? No pantsuit? No problem,” Clinton tweeted…. “I’ve got the must-have accessory for spring.”

RT reports: She then included a photo of her with her arms crossed donning a black facemask with the words “VOTE” written on it.

Unfortunately for the failed presidential candidate, the large black cloth mask has proven an irresistible target for meme-crafters online, who used it to photoshop their own messages instead. Those ranged from “Wisconsin” and “WNBP [will never be president]” – reminders of Clinton’s embarrassing loss to Donald Trump in 2016 – to “Epstein didn’t kill himself” – a nod to conspiracy theories surrounding the death of Jeffrey Epstein, who carried numerous connections to the Clintons while he was alive.

For others, the size of the mask has triggered flashbacks to movie villains like Bane from ‘The Dark Knight Rises’ and Hannibal Lecter from ‘The Silence of the Lambs’ – rather than served as a reminder to help stop the spread of Covid-19.
